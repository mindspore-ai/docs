## Document Construction

MindSpore tutorials and API documents can be generated by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). The following uses the Python API document as an example to describe the procedure, and ensure that MindSpore, MindSpore Hub and MindArmour have been installed.

1. Download code of the MindSpore Docs repository.
   ```shell
   git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs.git
   ```
2. Go to the api_python directory and install the dependency items in the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```shell
   cd docs/api_python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the following command in the api_python directory to create the `build_zh_cn/html` directory that stores the generated document web page. You can open `build_zh_cn/html/index.html` to view the API document.
   ```
   make html
   ```
   > If you only need to generate the MindSpore API, please modify the `source_zh_cn/conf.py` file, comment the `import mindspore_hub` and `import mindarmour` statements, and then perform this step.
