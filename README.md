## Document Construction

MindSpore tutorials and API documentation can be generated by the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) tool. Before building API documentation for MindSpore, MindSpore Hub, MindArmour or MindQuantum, the corresponding module must be completed installation. The following takes the MindSpore Python API document as an example to introduce the specific steps. The installation of MindSpore must be completed before the operation.

1. Use `pip` to install MindSpore module, which API documentation needs to built base on the installation, refe to [install](https://www.mindspore.cn/install).

    ```bash
    pip install mindspore-1.5.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl
    ```

2. Download code of the MindSpore Docs repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs.git -b r1.7
   ```

3. Go to the api_python directory and install the dependency items in the requirements.txt file.

   ```bash
   cd docs/mindspore/api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the following command in the api_python directory to create the `build_en/html` directory that stores the generated document web page. You can open `build_en/html/index.html` to view the API document.

   ```bash
   make html
   ```

> - When building the MindSpore and Lite API, you need to clone the `mindspore` repository because of some resource files will be used in it, and add the environment variable `MS_PATH`, Doxygen needs to be installed when building Lite API:
>
>   ```bash
>   git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore.git -b r1.7 {MS_REPO PATH}
>   sudo apt install doxygen
>   export MS_PATH={MS_REPO PATH}
>   ```
>
>   `{MS_REPO PATH}` is the path of `mindspore` repository on your computer.
>
> - When building the MindInsight, you need to clone the `mindinsight` repository because of some resource files will be used in it, and add the environment variable `MI_PATH`:
>
>   ```bash
>   git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindinsight.git -b r1.7 {MI_REPO PATH}
>   export MI_PATH={MI_REPO PATH}
>   ```
>
>   `{MI_REPO PATH}` is the path of `mindinsight` repository on your computer.
>
> - When building the MindArmour, you need to clone the `mindarmour` repository because of some resource files will be used in it, and add the environment variable `MA_PATH`:

>   export MA_PATH={MA_REPO PATH}
>   ```
>
>   `{MA_REPO PATH}` is the path of `mindarmour` repository on your computer.
>
> - When building the MindQuantum, you need to clone the `mindquantum` repository because of some resource files will be used in it, and add the environment variable `MQ_PATH`:

>
>   ```bash
>   git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/reinforcement.git -b r1.7 {RM_REPO PATH}
>   export RM_PATH={RM_REPO PATH}
>   ```
>
>   `{RM_REPO PATH}` is the path of `reinforcement` repository on your computer.
>
> - When building the Serving, you need to clone the `serving` repository because of some resource files will be used in it, and add the environment variable `SV_PATH`:
>
>   ```bash
>   git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/serving.git -b r1.7 {SV_REPO PATH}
>   export SV_PATH={SV_REPO PATH}
>   ```
>
>   `{SV_REPO PATH}` is the path of `serving` repository on your computer.
>
> - When building the Vision, you need to clone the `vision` repository because of some resource files will be used in it, and add the environment variable `VS_PATH`:
>
>   ```bash
>   git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/vision.git -b r1.7 {VS_REPO PATH}
>   export VS_PATH={VS_REPO PATH}
>   ```
>
>   `{VS_REPO PATH}` is the path of `vision` repository on your computer.
