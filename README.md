## Document Construction

MindSpore tutorials and API documentation can be generated by the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) tool. Before building API documentation for MindSpore, MindSpore Hub, MindArmour or MindQuantum, the corresponding module must be completed installation. The following takes the MindSpore Python API document as an example to introduce the specific steps. The installation of MindSpore must be completed before the operation.

1. Use `pip` to install MindSpore module, which API documentation needs to built base on the installation, refe to [install](https://www.mindspore.cn/install).

    ```bash
    pip install mindspore-1.5.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl
    ```

2. Download code of the MindSpore Docs repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs.git
   ```

3. Go to the api_python directory and install the dependency items in the requirements.txt file.

   ```bash
   cd docs/mindspore
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the following command in the api_python directory to create the `build_en/html` directory that stores the generated document web page. You can open `build_en/html/index.html` to view the API document.

   ```bash
   make html
   ```

### Note

1. When APIs for different repositories such as MindSpore, MindInsight, and MindQuantum are built, the following configuration list is given for use because some resource files corresponding to different repositories are used, and the corresponding repositories need to be cloned and the environment variables are configured:

   | Generation of the corresponding APIs | Environment variables | Repository links | Repository names |
   | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
   | MindSpore/ MindSpore Lite | MS_PATH | <https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore.git> | mindspore |
   | MindInsight | MI_PATH | <https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindinsight.git> | mindinsight |
   | MindArmour | MA_PATH | <https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindarmour.git> | mindarmour |
   | MindQuantum | MQ_PATH | <https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindquantum.git> | mindquantum |
   | Reinforcement | RM_PATH | <https://gitee.com/mindspore/reinforcement.git> | reinforcement |
   | Serving | SV_PATH | <https://gitee.com/mindspore/serving.git> | serving |
   | Vision | VS_PATH | <https://gitee.com/mindspore/vision.git> | vision |
   | Hub | HB_PATH | <https://gitee.com/mindspore/hub.git> | hub |
   | XAI | XA_PATH | https://gitee.com/mindspore/xai.git | xai |

   The code to clone the repositories and set the environment variables is as follows:

   ```bash
   git clone repository_link
   export environment_variable = corresponds_to_the_local_path_of_the_clone_repository
   ```

2. When the API of Lite is built, Doxygen needs to be installed:

      ```bash
      sudo apt install doxygen
      ```

3. When [MindSpore Tutorials](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/tree/r1.8/tutorials), [MindSpore Docs](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/tree/r1.8/docs/mindspore), [Deep Probability Programming Docs](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/tree/r1.8/docs/probability/docs) and [MindQuantum Docs](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/tree/r1.8/docs/mindquantum/docs) are built, [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) needs to be installed. For downloading and installing pandoc, refer to <https://pandoc.org/installing.html>。
