    "Suggestions on data loading performance optimization are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For commonly used datasets that have already provided loading interfaces, it is preferred to use the dataset loading interface provided by MindSpore to load, which can obtain better loading performance. For details, see [Built-in Dataset Loading Interfaces](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore.dataset.html). If the performance cannot meet the requirements, use the multi-thread concurrency solution, i.e., adjust the parameter `num_parallel_workers`(default: 8) of the dataset interface to achieve a better performance.\n",
    "- For a dataset format that is not supported, it is recommended to convert the dataset to the MindRecord data format before loading it using the `MindDataset` class (Please refer to the [API](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/dataset/mindspore.dataset.MindDataset.html) for detailed use). For detailed contents, please refer to [Converting Dataset to MindRecord](https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorials/en/master/dataset/record.html). If the performance cannot meet the requirements, use the multi-thread concurrency solution, i.e., adjust the parameter `num_parallel_workers`(default: 8) of the dataset interface to achieve a better performance.\n",
    "- For dataset formats that are not supported, the user-defined `GeneratorDataset` class is preferred for implementing fast algorithm verification (Please refer to the [API](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/dataset/mindspore.dataset.GeneratorDataset.html) for detailed use). If the performance cannot meet the requirements, the multi-process / multi-thread concurrency solution can be used. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Increase the parameter `num_parallel_workers`(default: 8) of the dataset interface to improve concurrency;\n",
    "    2. Set the parameter `python_multiprocessing`(default: True) of the dataset interface to True / False to enable multi-process / multi-thread concurrency mode. The multi-process mode achieves better performance in CPU-bound tasks, and multi-thread mode is better in IO bound tasks;\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Note**: If you set `python_multiprocessing=True`(default: True) and `num_parallel_workers>1`(default: 1), which indicates that the multi-process mode is started for data load acceleration. At this time, as the dataset iterates, the memory consumption of the subprocess will gradually increase, mainly because the subprocess of the user-defined dataset obtains the member variables from the main process in the Copy On Write way. Example: If you define a dataset with `__init__` function which contains a large number of member variable data (for example, a very large file name list is loaded during the dataset construction) and uses the multi-process mode, which may cause the problem of OOM (the estimated total memory usage is: `(num_parallel_workers+1) * size of the parent process` ). The simplest solution is to replace python objects (such as list/dict/int/float/string) with non referenced data types (such as Pandas, Numpy or PyArrow objects) for member variables, or load less meta data in member variables, or configure `python_multiprocessing=False` using multi-threading mode.\n",
    "    3. If there is `Using shared memory queue, but rowsize is larger than allocated memory ...` log prompt, then increase the parameter `max_rowsize` of dataset interface or set it to `None` to improve the efficiency of data transfer between processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the preceding suggestions of data loading performance optimization, this experience uses the built-in dataset load operation `Cifar10Dataset` class (Please refer to the [API](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/dataset/mindspore.dataset.Cifar10Dataset.html) for detailed use), the `MindDataset` class after data conversion, and uses the `GeneratorDataset` class to load data.

    "## Optimizing the Operating System Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Data processing is performed on the Host. Therefore, configurations of the running environment may affect the processing performance.  Major factors include storage, NUMA architecture, and CPU (computing resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "    The data loading process involves frequent disk operations, and the performance of disk reading and writing directly affects the speed of data loading. Solid State Drive (SSD) is recommended for storing large datasets when the dataset is large. SSDs generally have higher read and write speeds than ordinary disks, reducing the impact of I/O operations on data processing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In general, the loaded data will be cached into the operating system's page cache, which reduces the overhead of subsequent reads to a certain extent and accelerates the data loading speed of subsequent Epochs. Users can also manually cache the augmented data through the [single-node caching](https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorials/en/master/dataset/cache.html) technology provided by MindSpore, avoiding duplicate data loading and data augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NUMA architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "    NUMA, Non-Uniform Memory Access, is a memory architecture that was born to solve the scalability problem in the traditional symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) architecture. In traditional architectures, multiple processors share a memory bus, which is prone to problems such as insufficient bandwidth and memory conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the NUMA architecture, processors and memory are divided into groups, each called a node, each node has a separate integrated memory controller (IMC) bus for intra-node communication, and different nodes communicate with each other through a fast path interconnect (QPI). For a node, memory within the same node is called local memory, while memory in other nodes is called external memory. The delay in accessing local memory will be less than the delay in accessing external memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    During data processing, you can reduce the latency of memory access by binding the process to the node. In general, we can use the following command to bind the process to the node node, or you can configure the environment variable `export DATASET_ENABLE_NUMA=True` to make each training process bound to different numa nodes.\n",

These training processes allocate and compete for computing resources based on the policy of the operating system. When there is a large number of processes, data processing performance may deteriorate due to resource contention. In some cases, users need to manually allocate resources to avoid resource contention.\n",

    "\n",
    "        For energy efficiency reasons, the operating system adjusts the CPU operating frequency as needed, but lower power consumption means that computing performance is degraded and data processing is slowed down. In order to get the most out of the CPU's maximum computing power, you need to manually set the CPU's operating frequency. If it is found that the CPU operation mode of the operating system is balanced mode or energy-saving mode, you can improve the performance of data processing by adjusting it to performance mode.\n",

    "        1. If there is a `cv2` operation of opencv in the data processing, use `cv2.setNumThreads(2)` to set the number of `cv2` global threads.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The summary of the parameter `num_parallel_workers` set for each data loading and processing operation should not be greater than the maximum number of CPU cores of the machine, otherwise it will cause resource competition between each operation.\n",
    "- Before setting the num_parallel_workers parameter, it is recommended to use MindSpore's Profiler (performance analysis) tool to analyze the performance of each operation in the training, and allocate more resources to the operation with pool performance, that is, set a large num_parallel_workers to balance the throughput between various operations and avoid unnecessary waiting.\n",
    "- In a standalone training scenario, increasing the num_parallel_workers parameter can often directly improve processing performance, but in a distributed scenario, due to increased CPU competition, blindly increasing num_parallel_workers may lead to performance degradation. You need to try to use a compromise value."
