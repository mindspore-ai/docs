# SSD for Object Detection

## Model Introduction

Single shot multibox detector (SSD) is an object detection algorithm proposed by Wei Liu at ECCV 2016. On the VOC 2007 test set using NVIDIA Titan X, the SSD reaches 74.3% mAP(mean Average Precision) and 59 FPS for a 300 x 300 input network. For the 512 x 512 network, the SSD reaches 76.9% mAP, surpassing Faster RCNN (73.2% mAP). For details, see the paper<sup>[1]</sup>.
Mainstream SSD object detection algorithms are classified into the following types:

1. Two-stage method: RCNN series<br>

    The candidate boxes are generated through the algorithm, and then classified and regressed.<br>

2. One-stage method: YOLO and SSD<br>

    Location information is directly provided through the backbone network and does not need to be generated by region.<br>

SSD is the one-stage object detection algorithm. Feature extraction is performed by using a convolutional neural network, and different feature layers are used for detection output. Therefore, the SSD is a multi-scale detection method. At the feature layer to be detected, a 3 $\times$ 3 convolution is directly used to transform the channel. SSD uses the anchor policy, and anchors with different length-width ratios are preset. Each output feature layer predicts a plurality of detection boxes (4 or 6) based on the anchor. A multi-scale detection method is used. The shallow layer is used to detect small objects, and the deep layer is used to detect large objects. The following figure shows the SSD framework.

### Model Structure

The SSD uses VGG-16 as a basic model, and then adds a convolutional layer based on VGG-16 to obtain more feature maps for detection. The following figure shows the SSD network structure. The upper part is the SSD model, and the lower part is the YOLO model. It can be seen that the SSD uses a multi-scale feature map for detection.

![SSD-2](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_zh_cn/cv/images/SSD_2.jpg)
<br />

Comparison of two one-stage object detection algorithms:<br>
The SSD first performs feature extraction continuously through convolution. On a network that needs to detect an object, an output is directly obtained through 3 $\times$ 3 convolution. The number of convolution channels is determined by the number of anchors and the number of classes, which is equal to (Number of anchors x (Number of classes + 4)).
The SSD compares the YOLO series object detection methods. The difference is that the SSD obtains the final bounding box through convolution, while the YOLO obtains the one-dimensional vector in the form of full connection for the final output, and disassembles the vector to obtain the final detection box.

### Model Features

- Multi-scale object detection

    As shown in the SSD network structure, the SSD uses multiple feature layers. The sizes of the feature layers are 38 $\times$ 38, 19 $\times$ 19, 10 $\times$ 10, 5 $\times$ 5, 3 $\times$ 3, and 1 $\times$ 1. There are six feature map sizes in total. A large-scale feature map (a feature map in the front) can be used to detect small objects, and a small-scale feature map (a feature map in the rear) can be used to detect large objects. Multi-scale features have been proven highly effective for small object detection (the SSD belongs to intensive detection).

- Convolution used for detection

    Different from YOLO that finally uses a fully-connected layer, the SSD directly uses convolution to extract detection results from different feature maps. For a feature map whose shape is m $\times$ n $\times$ p, only a relatively small convolution kernel such as 3 $\times$ 3 $\times$ p needs to be used to obtain a detection value.

- Preset anchor

    In YOLOv1, a size of an object is directly predicted by a network. In this manner, a length-width ratio and a size of a prediction box are not limited, and training is difficult. In the SSD, a preset anchor (also called default bounding boxes in the SSD paper) is used. The size of the prediction box is fine-tuned under the guidance of anchor.

## Environment Preparation

This case is based on MindSpore. Before the experiment, ensure that mindspore, download, pycocotools, and opencv-python have been installed on the local host.

## Data Preparation and Processing

The dataset used in this case is COCO 2017. To facilitate data saving and loading, the COCO dataset is converted into the MindRecord format before data reading. The MindSpore Record data format reduces disk I/O and network I/O overheads, improving user experience and performance.
First, we need to download the processed COCO dataset in MindRecord format.
Run the following code to download and decompress the dataset to a specified path.

```python
from download import download

dataset_url = "https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/notebook/datasets/ssd_datasets.zip"
path = "./"
path = download(dataset_url, path, kind="zip", replace=True)
```

```text

```

Then We define some inputs for data processing.

```python
coco_root = "./datasets/"
anno_json = "./datasets/annotations/instances_val2017.json"

train_cls = ['background', 'person', 'bicycle', 'car', 'motorcycle', 'airplane', 'bus',
             'train', 'truck', 'boat', 'traffic light', 'fire hydrant',
             'stop sign', 'parking meter', 'bench', 'bird', 'cat', 'dog',
             'horse', 'sheep', 'cow', 'elephant', 'bear', 'zebra',
             'giraffe', 'backpack', 'umbrella', 'handbag', 'tie',
             'suitcase', 'frisbee', 'skis', 'snowboard', 'sports ball',
             'kite', 'baseball bat', 'baseball glove', 'skateboard',
             'surfboard', 'tennis racket', 'bottle', 'wine glass', 'cup',
             'fork', 'knife', 'spoon', 'bowl', 'banana', 'apple',
             'sandwich', 'orange', 'broccoli', 'carrot', 'hot dog', 'pizza',
             'donut', 'cake', 'chair', 'couch', 'potted plant', 'bed',
             'dining table', 'toilet', 'tv', 'laptop', 'mouse', 'remote',
             'keyboard', 'cell phone', 'microwave', 'oven', 'toaster', 'sink',
             'refrigerator', 'book', 'clock', 'vase', 'scissors',
             'teddy bear', 'hair drier', 'toothbrush']

train_cls_dict = {}
for i, cls in enumerate(train_cls):
    train_cls_dict[cls] = i
```

### Data Sampling

To make the model more robust to various input object sizes and shapes, the SSD algorithm randomly samples each training image using one of the following options:

- Use the entire original input image.

- Sample a region so that the minimum intersection-over-union ratio between the sampled region and the original image is 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, or 0.9.

- Randomly sample a region.

The size of each sampling region is [0.3,1] of the size of the original image, and the aspect ratio is between 1/2 and 2. If the center of the actual label box is within the sampling region, the overlapping part is retained as the real label box of the new image. After the foregoing sampling steps, each sampling region is adjusted to a fixed size, and is flipped horizontally with a probability of 0.5.

## Model Building

The SSD network structure consists of the following parts:

![SSD-3](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_zh_cn/cv/images/SSD_3.jpg)

- VGG16 Base Layer

- Extra Feature Layer

- Detection Layer

- NMS

- Anchor

### Backbone Layer

![SSD-4](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_en/cv/images/SSD_4.png)

After being preprocessed, the size of the input image is fixed at 300 x 300. The image passes through the backbone first. In this case, the first 13 convolutional layers of the VGG-16 network are used. Then, the fully-connected layers fc6 and fc7 of VGG-16 are respectively converted into 3 $\times$ 3 convolutional layer block 6 and 1 $\times$ 1 convolutional layer block 7, and features are further extracted. In block 6, a dilated convolution with 6 dilations is used, and padding of the dilated convolution is also 6. This is to increase a receptive field and keep the parameter quantity and the feature map size unchanged.

### Extra Feature Layer

On the basis of VGG-16, the SSD further adds four deep convolutional layers to extract higher-layer semantic information:

![SSD-5](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_zh_cn/cv/images/SSD_5.png)

Blocks 8 to 11 are used to extract higher semantic information. The number of channels in block 8 is 512, and the number of channels in block 9, block 10, and block 11 is 256. From block 7 to block 11, sizes of the five convolutional output feature maps are 19 x 19, 10 x 10, 5 x 5, 3 x 3, and 1 x 1 in sequence. To reduce the number of parameters, 1 x 1 convolution is used to reduce the number of channels to half of the number of output channels at this layer, and then 3 x 3 convolution is used for feature extraction.

### Anchor

The SSD uses the PriorBox to generate regions. The PriorBox with a fixed width and height is used as the prior region of interest, and a stage is used to complete classification and regression. A large number of dense PriorBoxes are designed to ensure that each region of the entire image is detected one by one. The PriorBox location is represented by the coordinates of the center point and the width and height of the box (cx,cy,w,h), and is converted into a percentage.
PriorBox generation rule:
The SSD uses six feature layers to detect objects. At different feature layers, the scale of the PriorBox is different. The scale of the lowest layer is 0.1, and the scale of the highest layer is 0.95. The calculation formulas for other layers are as follows:

![SSD-6](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_zh_cn/cv/images/SSD_6.jpg)

If the scale of a feature layer is fixed, PriorBox with different aspect ratios is set. The length and width of PriorBox are calculated as follows:

![SSD-7](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_zh_cn/cv/images/SSD_7.jpg)

When ratio is 1, a PriorBox (length-width ratio=1) of a specific scale is calculated based on the feature layer and the next feature layer. The calculation formula is as follows:

![SSD-8](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_zh_cn/cv/images/SSD_8.jpg)

PriorBox is generated for each point at each feature layer based on the preceding rules. (cx,cy) is determined by the current center point. Therefore, a large number of dense PriorBoxes are generated at each feature layer, as shown in the following figure.

![SSD-9](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_zh_cn/cv/images/SSD_9.png)

The SSD uses feature maps obtained by using six convolutional layers: the fourth, the seventh, the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, and the eleventh layers. Sizes of the six feature maps become smaller, and receptive fields corresponding to the six feature maps become larger. Each point on the six feature maps corresponds to 4, 6, 6, 6, 4, and 4 PriorBoxes respectively. Coordinates of a point in a feature map may be obtained based on a downsampling rate in the original image. Four or six PriorBoxes of different sizes are generated by using the coordinates as a center. Then, a prediction amount of a class and a location corresponding to each PriorBox is predicted by using a feature of the feature map. For example, the size of the feature map obtained by the eighth convolutional layer is 10 x 10 x 512, each point corresponds to six PriorBoxes, and there are 600 PriorBoxes in total. The MultiBox class is defined to generate multiple prediction boxes.

### Detection Layer

![SSD-10](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_en/cv/images/SSD_10.jpg)

The SSD model has six prediction feature maps in total. For a prediction feature map whose size is m\*n and channel is p, it is assumed that each pixel of the prediction feature map generates k anchors, and each anchor corresponds to c classes and four regression offsets. A convolution operation is performed on the prediction feature map by using (4+c)k convolution kernels whose sizes are 3x3 and channel is p, to obtain an output feature map whose sizes are m\*n and channel is (4+c)m\*k. It contains the regression offset and probability scores of each anchor generated on the prediction feature map. Therefore, for a prediction feature map whose size is m\*n, a total of (4+c)k\*m\*n results are generated. The number of output channels of the cls branch is k\*class_num, and the number of output channels of the loc branch is k\*4.

## Loss Function

The object function of the SSD algorithm is divided into two parts: calculating a confidence loss (conf) between a corresponding preselection box and a target category and a corresponding location loss (loc):

![SSD-11](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_zh_cn/cv/images/SSD_11.jpg)

In the preceding information:<br>
N indicates the number of positive samples in the prior box.<br>
c indicates the prediction value of class confidence.<br>
l indicates the location prediction value of the corresponding bounding box of the prior box.<br>
g indicates the location parameter of the ground truth.<br>
α is used to adjust the ratio of confidence loss to location loss. The default value is **1**.

### Location Loss Function

Smooth L1 Loss is used for all positive samples. The location information is encoded.

![SSD-12](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_zh_cn/cv/images/SSD_12.jpg)

### Confidence Loss Function

The confidence loss is the softmax loss on multi-class confidence (c).

def class_loss(logits, label):
    """Calculate category losses."""
    label = ops.one_hot(label, ops.shape(logits)[-1], Tensor(1.0, ms.float32), Tensor(0.0, ms.float32))
    weight = ops.ones_like(logits)
    pos_weight = ops.ones_like(logits)
    sigmiod_cross_entropy = ops.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, label, weight.astype(ms.float32), pos_weight.astype(ms.float32))
    sigmoid = ops.sigmoid(logits)
    label = label.astype(ms.float32)
    p_t = label * sigmoid + (1 - label) * (1 - sigmoid)
    modulating_factor = ops.pow(1 - p_t, 2.0)
    alpha_weight_factor = label * 0.75 + (1 - label) * (1 - 0.75)
    focal_loss = modulating_factor * alpha_weight_factor * sigmiod_cross_entropy
    return focal_loss
```

## Metrics

In SSD, non-maximum suppression (NMS) is not required during training. However, during inspection, for example, when an image is input and a box is required, the NMS needs to be used to filter out the prediction boxes that overlap with each other.<br>
The NMS process is as follows:

1. Sort by confidence score.

2. Select the ratio bounding box with the highest confidence to add to the final output list and remove it from the bounding box list.<br>

3. Calculate the region of all bounding boxes.<br>

4. Calculate the IoU of the bounding box with the highest confidence and other candidate boxes.<br>

5. Delete the bounding box where the IoU is greater than the threshold.<br>

6. Repeat the preceding steps until the bounding box list is empty.<br>

## Training Process

### (1) Prior box matching

During training, you need to determine the prior box to which the ground truth in the training image matches. The bounding box corresponding to the matched prior box is responsible for predicting the ground truth.

The principles for matching the prior box of the SSD with the ground truth are as follows:

1. For each ground truth in the image, find the prior box with the largest IoU. The prior box matches the ground truth. In this way, each ground truth must match a prior box. Generally, a prior box that matches the ground truth is referred to as a positive sample. On the contrary, if a prior box does not match any ground truth, the prior box can only match the background, and is a negative sample.

2. For the remaining unmatched prior boxes, if the IoU of a ground truth is greater than a threshold (generally 0.5), the prior box is also matched with the ground truth. Although a ground truth can match multiple prior boxes, there are too few ground truths compared with prior boxes. Therefore, there are many negative samples compared with positive samples. To ensure that positive and negative samples are balanced, the SSD uses hard negative mining, that is, negative samples are sampled. During sampling, negative samples are sorted in descending order based on confidence loss (a smaller confidence of the prediction background indicates a larger loss). The top-k samples with a larger loss are selected as negative samples for training, to ensure that the ratio of positive samples to negative samples is close to 1:3.

Notes:

1. Generally, a prior box that matches the ground truth is referred to as a positive sample. On the contrary, if a prior box does not match any ground truth, the prior box is referred to as a negative sample.

2. A ground truth can match multiple prior boxes, but each prior box can match only one ground truth.

3. If the IoUs of multiple ground truths and a prior box are all greater than the threshold, the prior box is matched only with the largest IoU.

![SSD-14](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_en/cv/images/SSD_14.jpg)

As shown in the preceding figure, the basic idea of matching prior boxes and ground truth boxes during training is as follows: Each prior box is regressed to the ground truth box. The control of this process requires the help of the loss layer. The loss layer calculates the error between the actual value and the prediction value to guide the learning direction.

### (2) Loss function

The loss function uses the weighted sum of the position loss function and the confidence loss function mentioned above.

### (3) Data augmentation

Use the previously defined data augmentation mode to perform data augmentation on the created data augmentation mode.

During model training, the number of epochs for model training is set to 60, and the training set and validation set are created using the create_ssd_dataset class. The value of **batch_size** is **5**, and the image size is adjusted to 300 x 300. The loss functions are the weighted sum of the position loss function and the confidence loss function. The optimizer is Momentum, and the initial learning rate is set to **0.001**. The callback functions LossMonitor and TimeMonitor are used to monitor the change of the loss value after each epoch ends during training and the running time of each epoch and step. The model is saved once every 10 epochs are trained.

## Evaluation

Customize the eval_net() class to evaluate the trained model and invoke the SsdInferWithDecoder class to return the predicted coordinates and labels. The average precision (AP) and average recall (AR) are then calculated for different IoU threshold, area, and maxDets settings. Use the COCOMetrics class to calculate mAP. The evaluation metrics of the model on the test set are as follows:

### AP and AR Explanations

- TP: IoU > Number of detection boxes with the specified threshold (The same ground truth is calculated only once.)

- FP: IoU ≤ Number of detection boxes with the specified threshold, or the number of redundant detection boxes with the same ground truth.

- FN: The number of GTs that are not detected.

### AP and AR Formulas

- Average precision (AP):

    ![SSD-15](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_zh_cn/cv/images/SSD_15.jpg)

    The AP is the ratio of the correct prediction result of positive samples to the sum of the prediction result of the positive samples and the incorrect prediction result, and mainly reflects an error rate of a prediction result.

- Average recall (AR):

    ![SSD-16](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/br_base/tutorials/source_zh_cn/cv/images/SSD_16.jpg)

    The AR is the ratio of the correct prediction result of positive samples to the sum of the correct prediction result of positive samples and the incorrect prediction result of positive samples. The AR mainly reflects the missing detection rate in the prediction result.

### Output Metrics for the Following Code Running Results

- The first value is the mAP(mean average precision), that is, the average value of APs of each class.

- The second value is the mAP value when IoU is set to 0.5, which is the evaluation standard of VOC.

- The third value is the mAP value that is strictly evaluated, which can reflect the position accuracy of the algorithm box. The middle values are the mAP values of the object size.

For the AR, check the mAR value when maxDets is 10/100 to reflect the detection rate. If the two values are close, it indicates that 100 boxes do not need to be detected for the dataset, which can improve the performance.
