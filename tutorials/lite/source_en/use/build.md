## Linux Environment Compilation

### Environment Requirements

- The compilation environment supports Linux x86_64 only. Ubuntu 18.04.02 LTS is recommended.

- Compilation dependencies of runtime(cpp):
    - [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) >= 3.18.3
    - [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) >= 7.3.0
    - [Android_NDK r20b](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r20b-linux-x86_64.zip)
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) >= 2.28.0

- Compilation dependencies of converter:
    - [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) >= 3.18.3
    - [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) >= 7.3.0
    - [Android_NDK r20b](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r20b-linux-x86_64.zip)

    - [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) >= 1.1.1

- Compilation dependencies of runtime(java)
    - [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) >= 3.18.3
    - [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) >= 7.3.0
    - [Android_NDK](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r20b-linux-x86_64.zip) >= r20
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) >= 2.28.0

> - To install and use `Android_NDK`, you need to configure environment variables. The command example is `export ANDROID_NDK=${NDK_PATH}/android-ndk-r20b`.
> - In the `build.sh` script, run the `git clone` command to obtain the code in the third-party dependency library. Ensure that the network settings of Git are correct.
> - After Gradle is installed, you need to add its installation path to the PATH: `export PATH=${GRADLE_PATH}/bin:$PATH`.
> - To install the Android SDK via `Android command line tools`, you need to create a new directory first and configure its path to the environment variable in `${ANDROID_SDK_ROOT}`, then create SDK via `sdkmanager`: `./sdkmanager --sdk_root=$ {ANDROID_SDK_ROOT} "cmdline-tools;latest"`, and finally accept the license through `sdkmanager` under the `${ANDROID_SDK_ROOT}` directory: `yes | ./sdkmanager --licenses`.
> - Compiling AAR relies on Android SDK Build-Tools, Android SDK Platform-Tools and other Android SDK related components. If the Android SDK in the environment does not have related components, the required dependencies will be automatically downloaded during compilation.
> - When compiling the NPU operator, you need to download [DDK V500.010](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/hiai-Library/ddk-download-0000001053590180), the directory where the compressed package is decompressed Set to the environment variable `${HWHIAI_DDK}`.

### Compilation Options

MindSpore Lite provides a compilation script `build.sh` for one-click compilation, located in the root directory of MindSpore. This script can be used to compile the code of training and inference. The following describes the compilation options of MindSpore Lite.

| Parameter  |  Parameter Description  | Value Range | Mandatory or No |
| -------- | ----- | ---- | ---- |
| -I | Selects an applicable architecture. This option is required when compile MindSpore Lite. | arm64, arm32, or x86_64 | No |
| -d | If this parameter is set, the debug version is compiled. Otherwise, the release version is compiled. | None | No |
| -i | If this parameter is set, incremental compilation is performed. Otherwise, full compilation is performed. | None | No |
| -j[n] | Sets the number of threads used during compilation. Otherwise, the number of threads is set to 8 by default. | Integer | No |
| -e | In the ARM architecture, select the backend operator. Otherwise, all operator of the framework is compiled at the same time. | cpu, gpu, npu | No |
| -h | Displays the compilation help information. | None | No |
| -n | Specifies to compile the lightweight image processing module. | lite_cv | No |
| -A | Language used by mindspore lite, default cpp. If the parameter is set to javaï¼Œthe AAR is compiled. | cpp, java | No |
| -C | If this parameter is set, the converter is compiled, default on. | on, off | No |
| -o | If this parameter is set, the benchmark and static library crop tool are compiled, default on. | on, off | No |
| -t | If this parameter is set, the testcase is compiled, default off. | on, off | No |
| -T | If this parameter is set, MindSpore Lite training version is compiled, i.e., this option is required when compiling, default off. | on, off | No |

> When the `-I` parameter changes, such as `-I x86_64` is converted to `-I arm64`, adding `-i` for parameter compilation does not take effect.
>
> When compiling the AAR package, the `-A java` parameter must be added, and there is no need to add the `-I` parameter. By default, the built-in CPU and GPU operators are compiled at the same time.
>
> The compiler will only generate training packages when `-T` is opened.
>
> Any `-e` compilation option, the CPU operators will be compiled into it.

### Compilation Example

First, download source code from the MindSpore code repository.

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore.git -b r1.1

    ```bash
    bash build.sh -A java
    ```

- Compile MindSpore Lite AAR, with the built-in CPU operators compiled:

    ```bash
