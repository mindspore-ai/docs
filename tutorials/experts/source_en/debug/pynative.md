# Applying PyNative Mode

[![View Source On Gitee](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/r1.8/resource/_static/logo_source_en.png)](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/r1.8/tutorials/experts/source_en/debug/pynative.md)

In PyNative mode, MindSpore supports the execution of single operators, ordinary functions and networks, as well as the operation of individual gradients. Below we will introduce the use of these operations and considerations in detail through sample code.

## Executing Operations

First, we import the dependencies and set the run mode to PyNative mode:

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore.ops as ops
import mindspore.nn as nn
import mindspore as ms

ms.set_context(mode=ms.PYNATIVE_MODE)
```

### Executing Single Operators

The following is example code of executing Add operator [mindspore.ops.Add](https://mindspore.cn/docs/zh-CN/r1.8/api_python/ops/mindspore.ops.Add.html#mindspore.ops.Add):

```python
add = ops.Add()
x = ms.Tensor(np.array([1, 2]).astype(np.float32))
y = ms.Tensor(np.array([3, 5]).astype(np.float32))
z = add(x, y)
print("x:", x.asnumpy(), "\ny:", y.asnumpy(), "\nz:", z.asnumpy())
```

### Executing Functions

Execute the custom function `add_func` and the sample code is as follows:

```python
add = ops.Add()

def add_func(x, y):
    z = add(x, y)
    z = add(z, x)
    return z

x = ms.Tensor(np.array([1, 2]).astype(np.float32))
y = ms.Tensor(np.array([3, 5]).astype(np.float32))
z = add_func(x, y)
print("x:", x.asnumpy(), "\ny:", y.asnumpy(), "\nz:", z.asnumpy())
```

### Executing Network

Execute a custom network `Net` to define the network structure in the construst, and the sample code is as follows:

```python
class Net(nn.Cell):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.mul = ops.Mul()

    def construct(self, x, y):
        return self.mul(x, y)

net = Net()
x = ms.Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]).astype(np.float32))
y = ms.Tensor(np.array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]).astype(np.float32))
z = net(x, y)

print("x:", x.asnumpy(), "\ny:", y.asnumpy(), "\nz:", z.asnumpy())
```

## Synchronous Execution

In PyNative mode, in order to improve performance, the operator uses asynchronous execution on the device, so when the operator executes incorrectly, the error message may not be displayed until the program is executed until the end. In response to this situation, MindSpore added a pynative_synchronize setting to control whether asynchronous execution is used on the operator device.

In PyNative mode, the operator defaults to asynchronous execution, and you can control whether the execution is asynchronous by setting the content. When operator execution fails, it is convenient to see the location of the code where the error occurred through the calling stack. The sample code is as follows:

```python
import mindspore as ms

# Synchronize operator execution by setting the pynative_synchronize
ms.set_context(mode=ms.PYNATIVE_MODE, pynative_synchronize=True)

class Net(nn.Cell):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.get_next = ops.GetNext([ms.float32], [(1, 1)], 1, "test")

    def construct(self, x1,):
        x = self.get_next()
        x = x + x1
        return x

ms.set_context()
x1 = np.random.randn(1, 1).astype(np.float32)
net = Net()
output = net(ms.Tensor(x1))
print(output.asnumpy())
```

Output: At this time, the operator is synchronous execution, and when the operator executes incorrectly, you can see the complete call stack and find the wrong line of code.
