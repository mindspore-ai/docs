MindSpore environment variables are as follows:

Operators Compile
-----------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 10 30 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Environment Variable
     - Function
     - Type
     - Value Range
     - Description
   * - MS_BUILD_PROCESS_NUM
     - Specifies the number of parallel operator build processes during Ascend backend compilation.
       
       Note: Only Ascend backend.
     - Integer
     - The number of parallel operator build processes ranges from 1 to 24.
     - 
   * - MS_COMPILER_CACHE_ENABLE
     - Specifies whether to save or load the cache of the graph compiled by front-end. 
       The function is the same as the `enable_compile_cache <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.set_context.html#mindspore.set_context>`_ in MindSpore context.

       Note: This environment variable has lower precedence than the context `enable_compile_cache`.
     - Integer
     - 0: Disable the compile cache

       1: Enable the compile cache
     - If it is used together with `MS_COMPILER_CACHE_PATH`, the directory for storing the cache files is `${MS_COMPILER_CACHE_PATH}` `/rank_${RANK_ID}` `/graph_cache/`. 
       `RANK_ID` is the unique ID for multi-cards training, the single card scenario defaults to `RANK_ID=0`.
   * - MS_COMPILER_CACHE_PATH
     - MindSpore compile cache directory and save the graph or operator cache files like `graph_cache`, `kernel_meta`, `somas_meta`.
     - String
     - File path, which can be a relative path or an absolute path.
     - 
   * - MS_COMPILER_OP_LEVEL
     - Enable debug function and generate the TBE instruction mapping file during Ascend backend compilation.

       Note: Only Ascend backend.
     - Integer
     - The value of compiler op level should be one of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

       0: Turn off op debug and delete op compile cache files

       1: Turn on debug, generate the `*.cce` and `*_loc.json`

       2: Turn on debug, generate the `*.cce` and `*_loc.json` files and turn off the compile optimization switch (The CCEC compiler option is set to `-O0-g`) at the same time

       3: Turn off op debug

       4: Turn off op debug, generate the `*.cce` and `*_loc.json` files, generate UB fusion calculation description files (`{$kernel_name}_compute.json`) for fusion ops
     - 
   * - MS_DEV_DISABLE_PREBUILD
     - Turn off operator prebuild processes during Ascend backend compilation. The prebuild processing may fix the attr `fusion_type` of the operate, and then affect the operator fusion. 
       If the performance of fusion operator can not meet the expectations, try to turn on this environment variable to verify if there is the performance problem of fusion operator.

       Note: Only Ascend backend.
     - Boolean
     - true: turn off prebuild

       false: enable prebuild
     -
