# Distributed Graph Partition

[![View Source On Gitee](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/master/resource/_static/logo_source_en.svg)](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/master/tutorials/experts/source_en/parallel/distributed_graph_partition.md)

## Overview

In large model training tasks, users often use various types of parallel algorithms to distribute computational tasks to various nodes, to make full use of computational resources, e.g., through MindSpore `operator-level parallelism`, `pipeline parallelism` and other features. However, in some scenarios, the user needs to slice the graph into multiple subgraphs based on a custom algorithm and distribute them to different processes for distributed execution. MindSpore `distributed graph partition` feature provides an operator-granularity Python layer API to allow users to freely perform graph slicing and build distributed training/inference tasks based on custom algorithms.

> Distributed graph slicing does not support PyNative mode.

Related interfaces:

1. `mindspore.nn.Cell.place(role, rank_id)`: Set a label for all operators in this Cell. This label tells the MindSpore compiler on which process this Cell is started. Each label consists of the process role `role` and `rank_id`, so by setting different labels for different Cells, these Cells will be started on different processes, allowing the user to perform tasks such as distributed training/inference.

2. `mindspore.ops.Primitive.place(role, rank_id)`: Set labels for Primitive operator, with the same function as `mindspore.nn.Cell.place(role, rank_id)` interface.

## Basic Principle

Distributed tasks need to be executed in a cluster. MindSpore reuses built-in [Dynamic Networking module](https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorials/experts/en/master/parallel/dynamic_cluster.html) of MindSpore in order to have better scalability and reliability in distributed graph partition scenarios.

For `distributed graph partition`, each process represents a compute node (called `Worker`), and the scheduling node (called `Scheduler`) started by the `dynamic networking` module mentioned above allows discovering each compute node and thus forming a compute cluster.

After `dynamic networking`, MindSpore assigns `role` and `rank`, the `role` and `id` of each process, based on the user startup configuration, both of which form a unique `tag` for each process and are input to the Python layer API `place`. With the correspondence, the user can set process labels for any operator by calling the `place` interface, and the MindSpore graph compiler module processes it to slice the computed graph into multiple subgraphs for distribution to different processes for execution. For the detailed use, please refer to [Primitive.place](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/ops/mindspore.ops.Primitive.html#mindspore.ops.Primitive.place) and [Cell.place](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/nn/mindspore.nn.Cell.html#mindspore.nn.Cell.place) interface document.
As an example, the compute topology after distributed graph partition might be as follows:

![image](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/master/tutorials/experts/source_zh_cn/parallel/images/distributed_graph_partition.png)

As shown in the figure above, each `Worker` has a portion of subgraphs that have been sliced by the user, with their own weights and inputs, and each `Worker` interacts with each other through the built-in `Rpc communication operator` for data interaction.

To ensure ease of use and user-friendliness, MindSpore also supports users to start dynamic networking and distributed training (without distinguishing between `Worker` and `Scheduler`) with a few modifications to a single script. See the following operation practice section for more details.

## Operation Practice

Taking LeNet training on GPU based on MNIST dataset as an example, different parts of the graph in the training task are split to different computational nodes for execution.

The directory structure is as follows:

```text
└─ sample_code
    ├─ distributed_graph_partition
       ├── lenet.py
       ├── run.sh
       └── train.py
```

> This tutorial does not involve starting across physical nodes, where all processes are on the same node. For MindSpore, there is no difference in the implementation of intra-node and cross-node distributed graph partition: after dynamic networking, graph slicing, and graph compilation processes, data interaction is performed via Rpc communication operators.

### Loading the Dataset

```python
import mindspore.dataset as ds
import mindspore.dataset.transforms as C
import mindspore.dataset.vision as CV
from mindspore.common import dtype as mstype
from mindspore.dataset.vision import Inter

def create_dataset(data_path, batch_size=32, repeat_size=1
                   num_parallel_workers=1):
    """
    create dataset for train or test
    """
    # define dataset
    mnist_ds = ds.MnistDataset(data_path)

    resize_height, resize_width = 32, 32
    rescale = 1.0 / 255.0
    shift = 0.0
    rescale_nml = 1 / 0.3081
    shift_nml = -1 * 0.1307 / 0.3081

    # define map operations
    resize_op = CV.Resize((resize_height, resize_width), interpolation=Inter.LINEAR)  # Bilinear mode
    rescale_nml_op = CV.Rescale(rescale_nml, shift_nml)
    rescale_op = CV.Rescale(rescale, shift)
    hwc2chw_op = CV.HWC2CHW()
    type_cast_op = C.TypeCast(mstype.int32)

    # apply map operations on images
    mnist_ds = mnist_ds.map(operations=type_cast_op, input_columns="label", num_parallel_workers=num_parallel_workers)
    mnist_ds = mnist_ds.map(operations=resize_op, input_columns="image", num_parallel_workers=num_parallel_workers)
    mnist_ds = mnist_ds.map(operations=rescale_op, input_columns="image", num_parallel_workers=num_parallel_workers)
    mnist_ds = mnist_ds.map(operations=rescale_nml_op, input_columns="image", num_parallel_workers=num_parallel_workers)
    mnist_ds = mnist_ds.map(operations=hwc2chw_op, input_columns="image", num_parallel_workers=num_parallel_workers)

    # apply DatasetOps
    buffer_size = 10000
    mnist_ds = mnist_ds.shuffle(buffer_size=buffer_size)
    mnist_ds = mnist_ds.batch(batch_size, drop_remainder=True)
    mnist_ds = mnist_ds.repeat(repeat_size)
    return mnist_ds
```

The above code creates the MNIST dataset.

### Constructing the LeNet Network

In order to make slicing to a single-machine single-card task, we need to first construct a single-machine single-card copy:

```python
import mindspore.nn as nn
from mindspore.common.initializer import TruncatedNormal

def conv(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride=1, padding=0):
    """weight initial for conv layer"""
    weight = weight_variable()
    return nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels,
                     kernel_size=kernel_size, stride=stride, padding=padding,
                     weight_init=weight, has_bias=False, pad_mode="valid")
def fc_with_initialize(input_channels, out_channels):
    """weight initial for fc layer"""
    weight = weight_variable()
    bias = weight_variable()
    return nn.Dense(input_channels, out_channels, weight, bias)
def weight_variable():
    """weight initial"""
    return TruncatedNormal(0.02)

class LeNet(nn.Cell):
    def __init__(self, num_class=10, channel=1):
        super(LeNet, self).__init__()
        self.num_class = num_class
        self.conv1 = conv(channel, 6, 5)
        self.conv2 = conv(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = fc_with_initialize(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = fc_with_initialize(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = fc_with_initialize(84, self.num_class)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.max_pool2d = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()

    def construct(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.max_pool2d(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.max_pool2d(x)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
```

### Calling the Interface for Distributed Graph Partition

For this training task we slice `fc1` to process `Worker 0`, `fc2` to process `Worker 1`, `fc3` to process `Worker 2`, `conv1` to process `Worker 3`, and `conv2` to process `Worker 4`.

Distributed graph sharding can be completed by adding the following graph partition statement after initializing the network.

```python
net = LeNet()
net.fc1.place("MS_WORKER", 0)
net.fc2.place("MS_WORKER", 1)
net.fc3.place("MS_WORKER", 2)
net.conv1.place("MS_WORKER", 3)
net.conv2.place("MS_WORKER", 4)
```

The first parameter of the `place` interface, `role`, is the process role, and the second parameter is the process `rank`, which means that the operator is executed on a process of such role. Currently the `place` interface only supports the `MS_WORKER` role, which represents the `Worker X` process described above.

It follows that a user can quickly implement a distributed training task by simply describing a custom algorithm through a single-machine copy and then setting the label of the compute node where the operator is located through the `place` interface. The advantages of this approach are:

**1.Instead of writing separate execution scripts for each compute node, users can execute distributed tasks with just one script, MindSpore.**

**2.Provides a more general and user-friendly interface. Through the `place` interface, users can intuitively describe their distributed training algorithms**

### Defining the Optimizer and Loss Function

```python
import mindspore.nn as nn

def get_optimizer(net, lr=0.01):
    momentum = 0.9
    mom_optimizer = nn.Momentum(filter(lambda x: x.requires_grad, net.get_parameters()), lr, momentum)
    return mom_optimizer
def get_loss():
    return nn.SoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits(sparse=True, reduction='mean')
```

### Executing the Training Code

The entry script train.py of training code:

```python
import mindspore as ms
from mindspore import set_seed
from mindspore.train.metrics import Accuracy
from mindspore.train import Model
from mindspore.train.callback import LossMonitor, TimeMonitor
from mindspore.communication import init, get_rank


ms.set_context(mode=ms.GRAPH_MODE)
init()
net = LeNet()
net.fc1.place("MS_WORKER", 0)
net.fc2.place("MS_WORKER", 1)
net.fc3.place("MS_WORKER", 2)
net.conv1.place("MS_WORKER", 3)
net.conv2.place("MS_WORKER", 4)

opt = get_optimizer(net)
criterion = get_loss()
model = Model(net, criterion, opt, metrics={"Accuracy": Accuracy()})

print("================= Start training =================", flush=True)
ds_train = create_dataset(os.path.join(os.getenv("DATA_PATH"), 'train'))
model.train(10, ds_train, callbacks=[LossMonitor(), TimeMonitor()],dataset_sink_mode=False)

print("================= Start testing =================", flush=True)
ds_eval = create_dataset(os.path.join(os.getenv("DATA_PATH"), 'test'))
acc = model.eval(ds_eval, dataset_sink_mode=False)

if get_rank() == 0:
    print("Accuracy is:", acc)
```

The above code trains first and then infers, where all processes are executed in a distributed manner.

- In a distributed graph partition scenario, the user must call `mindspore.communication.init`, an interface that is the entry point for MindSpore `dynamic networking` module, which is used to help form compute clusters, and initialize communication operators. If not called, MindSpore performs single-machine single-card training, i.e. the `place` interface will not take effect.
- Since only some subgraphs are executed on some processes, their inference precision or loss is not meaningful. The user only needs to focus on the precision on `Worker 0`.

### Preparation for Training Shell Script

#### Starting Scheduler and Worker Processes

Since multiple processes are started within a node, only one `Scheduler` process and multiple `Worker` processes need to be started via a Shell script. For the meaning of the environment variables in the script and their usage, refer to the [dynamic cluster environment variables](https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorials/experts/en/master/parallel/dynamic_cluster.html).

The run.sh execution script is as follows:

```bash
execute_path=$(pwd)

if [ ! -d "${execute_path}/MNIST_Data" ]; then
    if [ ! -f "${execute_path}/MNIST_Data.zip" ]; then
        wget http://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/notebook/datasets/MNIST_Data.zip
    fi
    unzip MNIST_Data.zip
fi

self_path=$(dirname $0)

# Set public environment.
export MS_WORKER_NUM=8
export MS_SCHED_HOST=127.0.0.1
export MS_SCHED_PORT=8118
export DATA_PATH=${execute_path}/MNIST_Data/

# Launch scheduler.
export MS_ROLE=MS_SCHED
rm -rf ${execute_path}/sched/
mkdir ${execute_path}/sched/
cd ${execute_path}/sched/ || exit
python ${self_path}/../train.py > sched.log 2>&1 &

# Launch workers.
export MS_ROLE=MS_WORKER
for((i=0;i<$MS_WORKER_NUM;i++));
do
  rm -rf ${execute_path}/worker_$i/
  mkdir ${execute_path}/worker_$i/
  cd ${execute_path}/worker_$i/ || exit
  python ${self_path}/../train.py > worker_$i.log 2>&1 &
done
echo "Start training. The output is saved in sched and worker_* folder."
```

In the above script, `export MS_WORKER_NUM=8` means that `8` `MS_WORKER` processes need to be started for this distributed execution. `export MS_SCHED_HOST=127.0.0.1` means the address of `Scheduler` is `127.0.0.1`. `export MS_SCHED_PORT=8118` means the open port of `Scheduler` is 8118, and all processes will connect to this port for dynamic networking.

The above environment variables are exported for both `Worker` and `Scheduler` processes, and then the corresponding roles are exported separately to start the processes for the corresponding roles: after `export MS_ROLE=MS_SCHED`, start the Scheduler process, and after `export MS_ROLE=MS_WORKER`, start the MS_WORKER_NUM worker process cyclically.

> Note that each process is executed in the background, so there will be a wait for the process to exit statement at the end of the script.

Executing instruction

```bash
bash run.sh
```

### Viewing the Execution Result

View accuracy execution instruction:

```bash
grep -rn "Accuracy" */*.log
```

Result:

```text
Accuracy is: {'Accuracy': 0.9888822115384616}
```

It shows that distributed graph Partition has no effect on LeNet training and inference results.

## Summary

MindSpore distributed graph partition feature provides users with `place` interface for operator granularity, which supports users to slice the compute graph according to custom algorithms and perform distributed training in various scenarios through dynamic networking.
The user only needs to make the following modifies to the single-machine single-card copy to initiate the task:

- Call the `mindspore.communication.init` interface at the top of the single-machine single-card copy to start dynamic networking.
- Call the `place` interface of `ops.Primitive` or `nn.Cell` for the operator or layer in the graph, based on the user algorithm, to set the label of the process where the operator is located.
- Start `Worker` and `Scheduler` processes via shell scripts to execute distributed tasks.

At present, the `place` interface is in a limited state of support, and advanced usage is in the development stage. Users are welcome to make various comments or issues on the MindSpore website.
The `place` interface currently has the following limitations:

- The input parameter `role` is only supported to be set to `MS_WORKER`. This is because each node in the distributed graph partition scenario is a compute node `Worker`, and setting other roles is not required for now.
- Unable to mix with Parameter Server, Data Parallelism, and Auto Parallelism. The compute graph of each process after distributed graph partition is not consistent, and all three features have copies of inter-process graphs or operators that may cause unknown errors when executed overlaid with this feature. Mixed-use features will be supported in subsequent releases.
- Control flow + distributed graph partition is in a limited support state and errors may be reported. This scenario will also be supported in subsequent releases.
