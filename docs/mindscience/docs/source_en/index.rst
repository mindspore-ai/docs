Typical MindScience Application Scenarios
------------------------------------------

1. `Electromagnetic simulation <https://www.mindspore.cn/mindscience/docs/en/master/mindelec/point_cloud.html>`_

   The efficient and easy-to-use AI electromagnetic simulation kit provides functions such as multimodality data transformation, high-dimensional data encoding, and innovative electromagnetic AI models. It has improved the performance by 10 times in scenarios such as mobile phone tolerance tests and achieved simulation precision comparable to conventional scientific computing.

2. `Computational Biology <./mindsponge/why.html>`_

   MindSpore SPONGE(Simulation Package tOwards Next GEneration molecular modelling) is a toolkit for Computational Biology based on AI framework [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/)ï¼Œwhich supports MD, folding and so on. It aims to provide efficient AI computational biology software for a wide range of scientific researchers, staff, teachers and students.
