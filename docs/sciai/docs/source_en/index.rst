Introduction to SciAI
=====================

Based on MindSpore, SciAI is a model library with 60 built-in most frequently used and cited AI4Sci(AI for Science) models, which cover SOTA models from physics-informed (PINNs, DeepRitz, PFNN, etc.) to neural operators (FNO, DeepONet, PDENet), ranking No.1 in the world in terms of coverage.
MindSpore SciAI provides the developers and users with a high-level API (auto configuration, auto instantiation, training and fine-tuning, etc.), allowing an immediate deployment.
With these features, SciAI provides developers and users with an efficient and convenient AI4SCI computation platform.
