    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the acoustic wave equation is a core technology in fields such as medical ultrasound and geological exploration. Large-scale acoustic wave equation solvers face challenges in terms of computational power and storage. Solvers for the wave equation generally use either frequency domain algorithms or time domain algorithms. The representative time domain algorithm is the Time Domain Finite Difference (TDFD) method, while frequency domain algorithms include Frequency Domain Finite Difference (FDFD), Finite Element Method (FEM), and Convergent Born Series (CBS) iterative method. The CBS method, due to its low memory requirement and absence of dispersion error, has gained widespread attention in engineering and academia. In particular, [Osnabrugge et al. (2016)](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021999116302595) have addressed the convergence issue of this method, expanding the application prospects of the CBS method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study will demonstrate how to invoke the CBS API provided by MindFlow to solve the two-dimensional acoustic wave equation."
