# Implementing Device Training Based On C++ Interface

<a href="https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/master/docs/lite/docs/source_en/quick_start/train_lenet.md" target="_blank"><img src="https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/master/resource/_static/logo_source_en.png"></a>

> MindSpore has unified the end-to-side cloud inference API. If you want to continue to use the MindSpore Lite independent API for training, you can refer to [here](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/en/r1.3/quick_start/train_lenet.html).

## Overview

Here we will demonstrate the code that trains a LeNet model using MindSpore Training-on-Device infrastructure. The code segments that are given below are provided fully in [train_lenet_cpp](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/master/mindspore/lite/examples/train_lenet_cpp/).

The completed training procedure is as follows:

1. Constructing your training model based on MindSpore Lite Architecture and Export it into `MindIR` model file.
2. Converting `MindIR` model file to the `MS` ToD model file by using MindSpore Lite `Converter` tool.
3. Loading `MS` model file and executing model training by calling MindSpore Lite training API.

Details will be told after environment deployed and model training by running prepared shell scripts.

## Environment Preparing

Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit operating system on x86 platform is recommended.

### Environment Requirements

- The compilation environment supports Linux x86_64 only. Ubuntu 18.04.02 LTS is recommended.

- Software dependency

    - [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) >= 7.3.0

    - [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) >= 3.18.3

    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) >= 2.28.0

    - [Android_NDK](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r20b-linux-x86_64.zip) >= r20
        - Configure environment variables: `export ANDROID_NDK=NDK path`.

### DataSet

The `MNIST` dataset used in this example consists of 10 classes of 28 x 28 pixels grayscale images. It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.

> Download the MNIST dataset at <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>. This page provides four download links of dataset files. The first two links are training dataset and training label, while the last two links are test dataset and test label.

Download and decompress the files to `/PATH/MNIST_Data/train` and `/PATH/MNIST_Data/test` separately.

The directory structure is as follows:

```text
└─MNIST_Data
    ├─test
    │      t10k-images.idx3-ubyte
    │      t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte
    │
    └─train
            train-images.idx3-ubyte
            train-labels.idx1-ubyte
```

### Installing MindSpore

MindSpore can be installed by source code or using `pip`. Refer [MindSpore installation guide](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/master/install/mindspore_cpu_install_pip_en.md#) for more details.

### Downloading and Installing MindSpore Lite

Use `git` to clone the source code, the command in `Linux` is as follows:

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore.git -b {version}
cd ./mindspore
```

The `mindspore/lite/examples/train_lenet_cpp` directory relative to the MindSpore Lite source code contains this demo's source code. The version is consistent with that of [MindSpore Lite Download Page](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/zh-CN/master/use/downloads.html) below. If -b the master is specified, you need to obtain the corresponding installation package through [compile from source](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/zh-CN/master/use/build.html).

Go to the [MindSpore Lite Download Page](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/zh-CN/master/use/downloads.html) to download the mindspore-lite-{version}-linux-x64.tar.gz and mindspore-lite-{version}-android-aarch64.tar.gz. The mindspore-lite-{version}-linux-x64.tar.gz is the MindSpore Lite install package for x86 platform, it contains the converter tool `converter_lite`, this demo uses it to converte `MIDIR` model to `.ms` which is supported by MindSpore Lite; The mindspore-lite-{version}-android-aarch64.tar.gz is the MindSpore Lite install package for Android, it contains training runtime library `libmindspore-lite.so`, this demo uses it to train model. Then put the files to the `output` directory relative to MindSpore Lite source code（if there is no `output` directory，you should create it).

Suppose these packags are downloaded in `/Downloads` directory, `Linux` commands for operations above is as follows:

```bash
mkdir output
cp /Downloads/mindspore-lite-{version}-linux-x64.tar.gz output/mindspore-lite-{version}-linux-x64.tar.gz
cp /Downloads/mindspore-lite-{version}0-android-aarch64.tar.gz output/mindspore-lite-{version}-android-aarch64.tar.gz
```

You can also [compile from source](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/zh-CN/master/use/build.html) to generate the training package for x86 platform mindspore-lite-{version}-linux-x64.tar.gz and for Andorid platform mindspore-lite-{version}-android-aarch64.tar.gz. These packages will directly generated in `output` directory and you should make sure that in the `output` directory both the two packages exist.

### Connecting Android Device

Turning on the 'USB debugging' mode of your Android device and connect it with your PC by using `adb` debugging tool (run`sudo apt install adb` in Ubuntu OS command line).

## Training and Evaluation

Enter the target directory and run the training bash script. The `Linux` command is as follows:

```bash
cd /mindspore/lite/examples/train_lenet_cpp
bash prepare_and_run.sh -D /PATH/MNIST_Data -t arm64
```

`/PATH/MNIST_Data` is the absolute mnist dataset path in your machine, `-t arm64` represents that we will train and run the model on an Android device, if the work computer is connected to multiple mobile devices, you can use `-i devices_id` to specify the running device.

The script `prepare_and_run.sh` has done the following works:

1. Export the `lenet_tod.mindir` model file.
2. Calling the converter tool in the last section and convert the `MINDIR` file to the `ms` file.
3. Push the `lenet.ms` model file, MNIST dataset and the related library files to your `Android` device.
4. Train, save and infer the model.

The model will be trained on your device and print training loss and accuracy value every epoch. The trained model will be saved as 'lenet_tod.ms' file. The 10 epochs training result of lenet is shown below (the classification accuracy varies in devices):

### Model Exporting

Whether it is an off-the-shelf prepared model, or a custom written model, the model needs to be exported to a `.mindir` file. Here we use the already-implemented [LeNet model](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/research/cv/lenet).

Import and instantiate a LeNet5 model and set the model to train mode:

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore as ms
from lenet import LeNet5
from train_utils import TrainWrap

n = LeNet5()
n.set_train()
ms.set_context(mode=ms.GRAPH_MODE, device_target="CPU", save_graphs=False)
```

Set MindSpore context and initialize the data and label tensors. In this case we use a MindSpore that was compiled for CPU. We define a batch size of 32 and initialize the tensors according to MNIST data -- single channel 32x32 images.

The tensors does not need to be loaded with relevant data, but the shape and type must be correct. Note also, that this export code runs on the server, and in this case uses the CPU device. However, the Training on Device will run according to the [context](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/en/master/use/runtime_train_cpp.html#creating-contexts)

```python
BATCH_SIZE = 32
x = ms.Tensor(np.ones((BATCH_SIZE, 1, 32, 32)), ms.float32)
label = ms.Tensor(np.zeros([BATCH_SIZE]).astype(np.int32))
net = TrainWrap(n)
```

Wrapping the network with a loss layer and an optimizer and `export` it to a `MindIR` file. `TrainWrap` is provided in the example as:

```python
from mindspore import nn
import mindspore as ms

def train_wrap(net, loss_fn=None, optimizer=None, weights=None):
    """
    train_wrap
    """
    if loss_fn is None:
        loss_fn = nn.SoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogits(reduction='mean', sparse=True)
    loss_net = nn.WithLossCell(net, loss_fn)
    loss_net.set_train()
    if weights is None:
        weights = ms.ParameterTuple(net.trainable_params())
    if optimizer is None:
        optimizer = nn.Adam(weights, learning_rate=0.003, beta1=0.9, beta2=0.999, eps=1e-5, use_locking=False, use_nesterov=False, weight_decay=4e-5, loss_scale=1.0)
    train_net = nn.TrainOneStepCell(loss_net, optimizer)
    return train_net
```

Finally, exporting the defined model.

```python
ms.export(net, x, label, file_name="lenet_tod", file_format='MINDIR')
print("finished exporting")
```

### Model Transferring

To convert the model simply use the converter as explained in the [Convert Section](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/en/master/use/converter_train.html#creating-mindspore-lite-models), the command is:

```bash
./converter_lite --fmk=MINDIR --trainModel=true --modelFile=lenet_tod.mindir --outputFile=lenet_tod
```

The exported file `lenet_tod.ms` is under the folder `./train_lenet_cpp/model`.

### Model Training

The model training progress is in [net_runner.cc](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/master/mindspore/lite/examples/train_lenet_cpp/src/net_runner.cc).

The main code continues as follows:

```cpp
int NetRunner::Main() {
  // Load model and create session
  InitAndFigureInputs();
  // initialize the dataset
  InitDB();
  // Execute the training
  TrainLoop();
  // Evaluate the trained model
  CalculateAccuracy();

  if (epochs_ > 0) {
    auto trained_fn = ms_file_.substr(0, ms_file_.find_last_of('.')) + "_trained.ms";
    mindspore::Serialization::ExportModel(*model_, mindspore::kMindIR, trained_fn, mindspore::kNoQuant, false);
    trained_fn = ms_file_.substr(0, ms_file_.find_last_of('.')) + "_infer.ms";
    mindspore::Serialization::ExportModel(*model_, mindspore::kMindIR, trained_fn, mindspore::kNoQuant, true);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

1. Loading Model

    `InitAndFigureInputs` creates the TrainSession instance from the `.ms` file, then sets the input tensors indices for the `.ms` model.

    ```cpp
    void NetRunner::InitAndFigureInputs() {
    auto context = std::make_shared<mindspore::Context>();
    auto cpu_context = std::make_shared<mindspore::CPUDeviceInfo>();
    cpu_context->SetEnableFP16(enable_fp16_);
    context->MutableDeviceInfo().push_back(cpu_context);

    graph_ = new mindspore::Graph();
    auto status = mindspore::Serialization::Load(ms_file_, mindspore::kMindIR, graph_);
    if (status != mindspore::kSuccess) {
        std::cout << "Error " << status << " during serialization of graph " << ms_file_;
        MS_ASSERT(status != mindspore::kSuccess);
    }

    auto cfg = std::make_shared<mindspore::TrainCfg>();
    if (enable_fp16_) {
        cfg.get()->optimization_level_ = mindspore::kO2;
    }

    model_ = new mindspore::Model();
    status = model_->Build(mindspore::GraphCell(*graph_), context, cfg);
    if (status != mindspore::kSuccess) {
        std::cout << "Error " << status << " during build of model " << ms_file_;
        MS_ASSERT(status != mindspore::kSuccess);
    }

    acc_metrics_ = std::shared_ptr<AccuracyMetrics>(new AccuracyMetrics);
    model_->InitMetrics({acc_metrics_.get()});

    auto inputs = model_->GetInputs();
    MS_ASSERT(inputs.size() >= 1);
    auto nhwc_input_dims = inputs.at(0).Shape();

    batch_size_ = nhwc_input_dims.at(0);
    h_ = nhwc_input_dims.at(1);
    w_ = nhwc_input_dims.at(2);
    }
    ```

2. Dataset Processing

    `InitDB` initializes the MNIST dataset and loads it into the memory. MindData has provided the data preprocessing API, the user could refer to the [C++ API Docs](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/api/en/master/api_cpp/mindspore_dataset.html) for more details.

    ```cpp
    int NetRunner::InitDB() {
    train_ds_ = Mnist(data_dir_ + "/train", "all", std::make_shared<SequentialSampler>(0, 0));

    TypeCast typecast_f(mindspore::DataType::kNumberTypeFloat32);
    Resize resize({h_, w_});
    train_ds_ = train_ds_->Map({&resize, &typecast_f}, {"image"});

    TypeCast typecast(mindspore::DataType::kNumberTypeInt32);
    train_ds_ = train_ds_->Map({&typecast}, {"label"});

    train_ds_ = train_ds_->Batch(batch_size_, true);

    if (verbose_) {
        std::cout << "DatasetSize is " << train_ds_->GetDatasetSize() << std::endl;
    }
    if (train_ds_->GetDatasetSize() == 0) {
        std::cout << "No relevant data was found in " << data_dir_ << std::endl;
        MS_ASSERT(train_ds_->GetDatasetSize() != 0);
    }
    return 0;
    }
    ```

3. Execute Training

    The `TrainLoop` method is the core of the training procedure. We first display its code then review it.

    ```cpp
    int NetRunner::TrainLoop() {
    mindspore::LossMonitor lm(100);
    mindspore::TrainAccuracy am(1);

    mindspore::CkptSaver cs(kSaveEpochs, std::string("lenet"));
    Rescaler rescale(kScalePoint);
    Measurement measure(epochs_);

    if (virtual_batch_ > 0) {
        model_->Train(epochs_, train_ds_, {&rescale, &lm, &cs, &measure});
    } else {
        struct mindspore::StepLRLambda step_lr_lambda(1, kGammaFactor);
        mindspore::LRScheduler step_lr_sched(mindspore::StepLRLambda, static_cast<void *>(&step_lr_lambda), 1);
        model_->Train(epochs_, train_ds_, {&rescale, &lm, &cs, &am, &step_lr_sched, &measure});
    }

    return 0;
    }
    ```

4. Execute Evaluating

    To eval the model accuracy, the `CalculateAccuracy` method is being called. Within which, the model is switched to `Eval` mode, and the method runs a cycle of test tensors through the trained network to measure the current accuracy rate.

    ```cpp
    float NetRunner::CalculateAccuracy(int max_tests) {
    test_ds_ = Mnist(data_dir_ + "/test", "all");
    TypeCast typecast_f(mindspore::DataType::kNumberTypeFloat32);
    Resize resize({h_, w_});
    test_ds_ = test_ds_->Map({&resize, &typecast_f}, {"image"});

    TypeCast typecast(mindspore::DataType::kNumberTypeInt32);
    test_ds_ = test_ds_->Map({&typecast}, {"label"});
    test_ds_ = test_ds_->Batch(batch_size_, true);

    model_->Evaluate(test_ds_, {});
    std::cout << "Accuracy is " << acc_metrics_->Eval() << std::endl;

    return 0.0;
    }
    ```
