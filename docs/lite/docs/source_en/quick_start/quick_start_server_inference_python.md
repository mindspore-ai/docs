# Experiencing the Python Simplified Concurrent Inference Demo

<a href="https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/r2.0.0-alpha/docs/lite/docs/source_en/quick_start/quick_start_server_inference_python.md" target="_blank"><img src="https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/r2.0.0-alpha/resource/_static/logo_source_en.png"></a>

## Overview

This tutorial provides a sample program for MindSpore Lite to perform concurrent inference. By creating concurrent inference configuration, loading and compiling concurrent Runner, setting concurrent inference task, and executing concurrent inference, it demonstrates the basic process of [Python interface](https://mindspore.cn/lite/api/en/r2.0.0-alpha/mindspore_lite.html) for server-side concurrent inference, so that users can quickly understand the use of MindSpore Lite to perform concurrent inference-related APIs. The related code is located in [mindspore/lite/examples/quick_start_server_inference_python](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/r2.0.0-alpha/mindspore/lite/examples/quick_start_server_inference_python) directory.

The usage scenario simulated by this tutorial: When the server receives inference tasks requested by multiple clients at the same time, it uses the [ModelParallelRunner](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/api/en/r2.0.0-alpha/mindspore_lite/mindspore_lite.ModelParallelRunner.html) interface that supports concurrent inference. Multiple inference tasks are performed at the same time and the results are returned to the client.

The following is an example of how to use the Python simplified concurrent inference demo on a Linux X86 operating system and a CPU hardware platform, taking Ubuntu 18.04 as an example.

- One-click installation of inference-related model files, MindSpore Lite and its required dependencies. See the [One-click installation](#one-click-installation) section for details.

- Execute the Python Simplified Inference Demo. See the [Execute Demo](#executing-demo) section for details.

- For a description of the Python Simplified Inference Demo content, see the [Demo Content Description](#demo-content-description) section for details.

## One-click Installation

This session introduces the installation of MindSpore Lite for Python version 3.7 via pip on a Linux-x86_64 system with a CPU environment, taking the new Ubuntu 18.04 as an example.

Go to [mindspore/lite/examples/quick_start_server_inference_python](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/r2.0.0-alpha/mindspore/lite/examples/quick_start_server_inference_python) directory, and execute the `lite-server-cpu-pip.sh` script to install in one click, taking MindSpore Lite version 1.9.0 as an example. The installation script downloads the model and input data files required for concurrent inference, installs the dependencies required for MindSpore_Lite, and downloads and installs MindSpore Lite that supports concurrent inference.

Note: This command sets the installed version of MindSpore Lite. Since the Python interface is supported from MindSpore Lite version 1.8.0, the version cannot be set lower than 1.8.0. For the versions that can be set, see the version provided in [Download MindSpore Lite](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/zh-CN/r2.0.0-alpha/use/downloads.html) for details.

  ```bash
  MINDSPORE_LITE_VERSION=1.9.0 bash ./lite-server-cpu-pip.sh
  ```

> If the MobileNetV2 model download fails, please manually download the relevant model file [mobilenetv2.ms](https://download.mindspore.cn/model_zoo/official/lite/quick_start/mobilenetv2.ms) and copy it to the `mindspore/lite/examples/quick_start_server_inference_python/model` directory.
>
> If the input.bin input data files download fails, please manually download the relevant model file [input.bin](https://download.mindspore.cn/model_zoo/official/lite/quick_start/input.bin) and copy it to the `mindspore/lite/examples/quick_start_server_inference_python/model` directory.
>
> If you fail to download MindSpore Lite Concurrent Inference Framework by using the script, please manually download [MindSpore Lite Concurrent Model Inference Framework](https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/1.9.0/MindSpore/lite/release/linux/x86_64/server/mindspore_lite-1.9.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl) for the corresponding hardware platform of CPU and operating system of Linux-x86_64 or [MindSpore Lite Concurrent Model Inference Framework](https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/1.9.0/MindSpore/lite/release/linux/aarch64/server/mindspore_lite-1.9.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_aarch64.whl) for the corresponding hardware platform of CPU and operating system of Linux-aarch64. Users can use the `uname -m` command to query the operating system on the terminal, and copy it to `mindspore/lite/examples/quick_start_server_inference_python` directory.
>
> If you need to use MindSpore Lite corresponding to Python 3.7 or above, please [compile](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/en/r2.0.0-alpha/use/build.html) locally, noting that the Python API module compilation depends on Python >= 3.7.0, NumPy >= 1.17.0, wheel >= 0.32.0. It should be noted that to generate a MindSpore Lite installation package that supports concurrent inference, and you need to configure the environment variable before compiling: export MSLITE_ENABLE_SERVER_INFERENCE=on. After successful compilation, copy the Whl installation package generated in the `output/` directory to the `mindspore/lite/examples/quick_start_server_inference_python` directory.
>
> If the MindSpore Lite installation package does not exist in the `mindspore/lite/examples/quick_start_server_inference_python` directory, the one-click installation script will uninstall the currently installed MindSpore Lite and then download and install MindSpore Lite from the Huawei image. Otherwise, if the MindSpore Lite installation package exists in the directory, it will install it first.
>
> After manually downloading and placing the files in the specified directory, you need to execute the lite-server-cpu-pip.sh script again to complete the one-click installation.

A successful execution will show the following results. The model files and input data files can be found in the `mindspore/lite/examples/quick_start_server_inference_python/model` directory.

```

## Executing Demo

After one-click installation, go to the [mindspore/lite/examples/quick_start_server_inference_python](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/r2.0.0-alpha/mindspore/ lite/examples/quick_start_server_inference_python) directory and execute the following command to experience the MindSpore Lite concurrent inference MobileNetV2 model.

```bash
python quick_start_server_inferece_python.py
```

The following results will be obtained when the execution is completed. During the execution of concurrent inference tasks in multiple threads, the single time-consuming inference and inference results in concurrent inference are printed, and the total concurrent inference time-consuming is printed after ending the thread.

Description of inference results:

- Simulates 5 clients and sends concurrent inference task requests to the server at the same time, with `parallel id` denoting the client id.

- Simulates each client to send 2 requests for inference tasks to the server, and `task index` denotes the serial number of the task.

- `run once time` indicates the inference time for a single requested inference task per client.

- Next, the inference results of each client for single requested inference task are displayed, including the name of the output Tensor, the data size of the output Tensor, the number of elements of the output Tensor, and the first 5 pieces of data.

- `total run time` indicates the total time taken by the server to complete all concurrent inference tasks.

## Demo Content Description

Performing concurrent inference with MindSpore Lite consists of the following main steps:

1. [key variable description](#key-variable-description): Description of the key variables used in concurrent inference.
2. [Create concurrent inference configuration](#creating-concurrent-inference-configuration): Create the concurrent inference configuration option [RunnerConfig](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/api/en/r2.0.0-alpha/mindspore_lite/mindspore_lite.RunnerConfig.html) to save some basic configuration parameters used to perform the initialization of concurrent inference.
3. [Concurrent Runner loading and compilation](#concurrent-runner-loading-and-compilation): Before performing concurrent inference, you need to call [init](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/api/en/r2.0.0-alpha/mindspore_lite/mindspore_lite.ModelParallelRunner.html#mindspore_lite.ModelParallelRunner.init) interface of `ModelParallelRunner` for concurrent Runner initialization, mainly for model reading, loading `RunnerConfig` configuration, creating concurrency, and subgraph slicing and operator selection scheduling. The `ModelParallelRunner` can be understood as a `model` that supports concurrent inference. This phase can take more time, so it is recommended that `ModelParallelRunner` be initialized once and perform concurrent inference multiple times.
4. [Set concurrent inference task](#setting-concurrent-inference-task): Create multiple threads and bind concurrent inference tasks. The inference tasks include populating the `Input Tensor` with data, using the [predict](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/api/en/r2.0.0-alpha/mindspore_lite/mindspore_lite.ModelParallelRunner.html#mindspore_lite.ModelParallelRunner.predict) interface of `ModelParallelRunner` for concurrent inference and getting inference results via the `output Tensor`.
5. [perform concurrent inference](#performing-concurrent-inference): Start multiple threads and execute the configured concurrent inference tasks. During execution, the single inference time consumption and inference result in concurrent inference are printed, and the total concurrent inference time consumption is printed after the end of the thread.

For more advanced usage and examples of Python interfaces, please refer to the [Python API](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/api/en/r2.0.0-alpha/mindspore_lite.html).

### Key Variable Description

- `THREAD_NUM`: the number of threads in a single worker. `WORKERS_NUM * THREAD_NUM` should be less than the number of machine cores.

- `WORKERS_NUM`: On the server side, specify the number of workers in a `ModelParallelRunner`, i.e., the units that perform concurrent inference. If you want to compare the difference in inference time between concurrent inference and non-concurrent inference, you can set `WORKERS_NUM` to 1 for comparison.

- `PARALLEL_NUM`: The number of concurrent, i.e., the number of clients that are sending inference task requests at the same time.

- `TASK_NUM`: The number of tasks, i.e., the number of inference task requests sent by a single client.

    ```python
    import time
    from threading import Thread
    import numpy as np
    import mindspore_lite as mslite

    # the number of threads of one worker.
    # WORKERS_NUM * THREAD_NUM should not exceed the number of cores of the machine.
    THREAD_NUM = 1

    # In parallel inference, the number of workers in one `ModelParallelRunner` in server.
    # If you prepare to compare the time difference between parallel inference and serial inference,
    # you can set WORKERS_NUM = 1 as serial inference.
    WORKERS_NUM = 3

    # Simulate 5 clients, and each client sends 2 inference tasks to the server at the same time.
    PARALLEL_NUM = 5
    TASK_NUM = 2
    ```

### Creating Concurrent Inference Configuration

Create concurrent inference configuration `RunnerConfig`. Since this tutorial demonstrates a scenario where inference is performed on a CPU device, it is necessary to add the created CPU device hardware information to the context `Conterxt` and then add `Conterxt` to `RunnerConfig`.

```python
# Init RunnerConfig and context, and add CPU device info
cpu_device_info = mslite.CPUDeviceInfo(enable_fp16=False)
context = mslite.Context(thread_num=THREAD_NUM, inter_op_parallel_num=THREAD_NUM)
context.append_device_info(cpu_device_info)
parallel_runner_config = mslite.RunnerConfig(context=context, workers_num=WORKERS_NUM)
```

### Concurrent Runner Loading and Compilation

Call [init](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/api/en/r2.0.0-alpha/mindspore_lite/mindspore_lite.ModelParallelRunner.html#mindspore_lite.ModelParallelRunner.init) interface of `ModelParallelRunner` for concurrent Runner initialization, mainly for model reading, loading `RunnerConfig` configuration, creating concurrency, and subgraph slicing and operator selection scheduling. The `ModelParallelRunner` can be understood as a `Model` that supports concurrent inference. This phase can take more time, so it is recommended that `ModelParallelRunner` be initialized once and perform concurrent inference multiple times.

```python
# Build ModelParallelRunner from file
model_parallel_runner = mslite.ModelParallelRunner()
model_parallel_runner.init(model_path="./model/mobilenetv2.ms", runner_config=parallel_runner_config)
```

### Setting Concurrent Inference Task

Create multiple threads and bind concurrent inference tasks. The inference tasks include populating the `Input Tensor` with data, using the [predict](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/api/en/r2.0.0-alpha/mindspore_lite/mindspore_lite.ModelParallelRunner.html#mindspore_lite.ModelParallelRunner.predict) interface of `ModelParallelRunner` for concurrent inference and getting inference results via the `output Tensor`.

```python
def parallel_runner_predict(parallel_runner, parallel_id):
    """
    One Runner with 3 workers, set model input, execute inference and get output.

    Args:
        parallel_runner (mindspore_lite.ModelParallelRunner): Actuator Supporting Parallel inference.
        parallel_id (int): Simulate which client's task to process
    """

    task_index = 0
    while True:
        if task_index == TASK_NUM:
            break
        task_index += 1
        # Set model input
        inputs = parallel_runner.get_inputs()
        in_data = np.fromfile("./model/input.bin", dtype=np.float32)
        inputs[0].set_data_from_numpy(in_data)
        once_start_time = time.time()
        # Execute inference
        outputs = []
        parallel_runner.predict(inputs, outputs)
        once_end_time = time.time()
        print("parallel id: ", parallel_id, " | task index: ", task_index, " | run once time: ",
              once_end_time - once_start_time, " s")
        # Get output
        for output in outputs:
            tensor_name = output.get_tensor_name().rstrip()
            data_size = output.get_data_size()
            element_num = output.get_element_num()
            print("tensor name is:%s tensor size is:%s tensor elements num is:%s" % (tensor_name, data_size,
                                                                                     element_num))
            data = output.get_data_to_numpy()
            data = data.flatten()
            print("output data is:", end=" ")
            for j in range(5):
                print(data[j], end=" ")
            print("")


# The server creates 5 threads to store the inference tasks of 5 clients.
threads = []
total_start_time = time.time()
for i in range(PARALLEL_NUM):
    threads.append(Thread(target=parallel_runner_predict, args=(model_parallel_runner, i,)))
```

### Performing Concurrent Inference

Start multiple threads and execute the configured concurrent inference tasks. During execution, the single inference time consumption and inference result in concurrent inference are printed, and the total concurrent inference time consumption is printed after the end of the thread.

```python
# Start threads to perform parallel inference.
for th in threads:
    th.start()
for th in threads:
    th.join()
total_end_time = time.time()
print("total run time: ", total_end_time - total_start_time, " s")
```
