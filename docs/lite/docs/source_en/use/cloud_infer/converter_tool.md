## Overview

MindSpore Lite cloud-side inference provides tools for offline conversion of models, and supports many types of model conversions, and the converted models can be used for inference. Command line parameters include a variety of personalized options to provide users with convenient conversion paths.

The currently supported input formats are MindSpore, TensorFlow Lite, Caffe, TensorFlow, and ONNX.

The `mindir` model converted by the converter supports the converter companion and higher versions of the Runtime inference framework to perform inference.

## Linux Environment Usage Instructions

### Environment Preparation

To use MindSpore Lite cloud-side inference model converter, the following environment preparation is required.

- [Compile](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/en/master/use/cloud_infer/build.html) or [download](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/en/master/use/downloads.html) model converter.
- Add the dynamic link libraries required by the converter to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    ```bash
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH}/tools/converter/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    ```

    ${PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH} is the path of the compiled or downloaded package after unpacking.

Detailed parameter descriptions are provided below.

| Parameters  |  Required or not   |  Description of parameters  | Value range | Default values | Remarks |
| -------- | ------- | ----- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| `--help` | Not | Print all help information. | - | - | - |
| `--fmk=<FMK>` | Required | The original format of the input model. | MINDIR、CAFFE、TFLITE、TF、ONNX | - | - |
| `--modelFile=<MODELFILE>` | Required | The path of the input model. | - | - | - |

| `--saveType=<SAVETYPE>` | Not | Set the exported model as `mindir` model or `ms` model. | MINDIR, MINDIR_LITE | MINDIR | This version can only be reasoned with models turned out by setting to MINDIR |
| `--optimize=<OPTIMIZE>` | Not | Set the optimization accomplished in the process of converting model. | none, general, gpu_oriented, ascend_oriented| general | - |
| `--decryptKey=<DECRYPTKEY>` | Not | Set the key used to load the cipher text MindIR. The key is expressed in hexadecimal and is only valid when `fmk` is MINDIR. | - | - | - |

| `--encryptKey=<ENCRYPTKEY>` | Not | Set the key to export the encryption `mindir` model. The key is expressed in hexadecimal. Only AES-GCM is supported, and the key length is only 16Byte. | - | - | - |
| `--encryption=<ENCRYPTION>` | Not | Set whether to encrypt when exporting `mindir` models. Export encryption protects model integrity, but increases runtime initialization time. | true, false | true | - |
| `--infer=<INFER>` | Not | Set whether to perform pre-inference when the conversion is completed. | true, false | false | - |
| `--inputDataFormat=<INPUTDATAFORMAT>` | Not | Set the input format of the exported model, valid only for 4-dimensional inputs. | NHWC, NCHW | - | - |

| `--inputDataType=<INPUTDATATYPE>` | Not | Set the data type of the quantized model input tensor. Only if the quantization parameters (scale and zero point) of the model input tensor are available. The default is to keep the same data type as the original model input tensor. | FLOAT32, INT8, UINT8, DEFAULT | DEFAULT | Not supported at the moment |
| `--outputDataType=<OUTPUTDATATYPE>` | Not | Set the data type of the quantized model output tensor. Only if the quantization parameters (scale and zero point) of the model output tensor are available. The default is to keep the same data type as the original model output tensor. | FLOAT32, INT8, UINT8, DEFAULT | DEFAULT | Not supported at the moment |
| `--device=<DEVICE>` | Not | Set target device when converter model. The use case is when on the Ascend device, if you need to the converted model to have the ability to use Ascend backend to perform inference, you can set the parameter. If it is not set, the converted model will use CPU backend to perform inference by default. | This option will be deprecated. It is replaced by setting `optimize` option to `ascend_oriented` |

Notes:

- The parameter name and the parameter value are connected by an equal sign without any space between them.
- Caffe models are generally divided into two files: `*.prototxt` model structure, corresponding to the `--modelFile` parameter, and `*.caffemodel` model weights, corresponding to the `--weightFile` parameter.
- The `configFile` configuration file uses the `key=value` approach to define the relevant parameters.
- `--optimize` parameter is used to set the mode of optimization during the offline conversion. If this parameter is set to none, no relevant graph optimization operations will be performed during the offline conversion phase of the model, and the relevant graph optimization operations will be done during the execution of the inference phase. The advantage of this parameter is that the converted model can be deployed directly to any CPU/GPU/Ascend hardware backend since it is not optimized in a specific way, while the disadvantage is that the initialization time of the model increases during inference execution. If this parameter is set to general, general optimization will be performed, such as constant folding and operator fusion (the converted model only supports CPU/GPU hardware backend, not Ascend backend). If this parameter is set to gpu_oriented, the general optimization and extra optimization for GPU hardware will be performed (the converted model only supports GPU hardware backend). If this parameter is set to ascend_oriented, the optimization for Ascend hardware will be performed (the converted model only supports Ascend hardware backend).
- The encryption and decryption function only takes effect when `MSLITE_ENABLE_MODEL_ENCRYPTION=on` is set at [compile](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/en/master/use/cloud_infer/build.html) time and only supports Linux x86 platforms. `decrypt_key` and `encrypt_key` are string expressed in hexadecimal. For example, if encrypt_key is set as "30313233343637383939414243444546", the corresponding hexadecimal expression is '(b)0123456789ABCDEF' . Linux platform users can use the' xxd 'tool to convert the key expressed in bytes into hexadecimal expressions.
- For the MindSpore model, since it is already a `mindir` model, two approaches are suggested:

    Inference is performed directly without offline conversion.

    When using offline conversion, setting `--optimize` to general in CPU/GPU hardware backend (for general optimization), setting `--optimize` to gpu_oriented in GPU hardware (for GPU extra optimization based on general optimization), setting `--optimize` to ascend_oriented in Ascend hardware. The relevant optimization is done in the offline phase to reduce the initialization time of inference execution.

### Usage Examples

The following selects common examples to illustrate the use of the conversion command.

- Take the Caffe model LeNet as an example and execute the conversion command.

    ```bash
    ./converter_lite --fmk=CAFFE --saveType=MINDIR --optimize=none --modelFile=lenet.prototxt --weightFile=lenet.caffemodel --outputFile=lenet
    ```

    In this example, because the Caffe model is used, two input files, model structure and model weights, are required. Together with the other two required parameters, fmk type and output path, it can be executed successfully.

    The result is shown as:

    ```text
    CONVERT RESULT SUCCESS:0
    ```

    This indicates that the Caffe model has been successfully converted into a MindSpore Lite cloud-side inference model, obtaining the new file `lenet.mindir`.

- Take MindSpore, TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow and ONNX models as examples and execute the conversion command.

    - MindSpore model `model.mindir`

    ```bash
    ./converter_lite --fmk=MINDIR --saveType=MINDIR --optimize=general --modelFile=model.mindir --outputFile=model
    ```

    - TensorFlow Lite model `model.tflite`

    ```bash
    ./converter_lite --fmk=TFLITE --saveType=MINDIR --optimize=none --modelFile=model.tflite --outputFile=model
    ```

    - TensorFlow model `model.pb`

    ```bash
    ./converter_lite --fmk=TF --saveType=MINDIR --optimize=none --modelFile=model.pb --outputFile=model
    ```

    - ONNX model `model.onnx`

    ```bash
    ./converter_lite --fmk=ONNX --saveType=MINDIR --optimize=none --modelFile=model.onnx --outputFile=model
    ```

    In all of the above cases, the following conversion success message is displayed and the `model.mindir` target file is obtained at the same time.

    ```text
    CONVERTER RESULT SUCCESS:0
    ```
