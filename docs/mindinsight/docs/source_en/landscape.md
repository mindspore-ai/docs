# Training Optimization Process Visualization

[![View Source On Gitee](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/master/resource/_static/logo_source_en.png)](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/master/docs/mindinsight/docs/source_en/landscape.md)&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Overview

Neural network training is essentially an optimization process of high-dimensional non-convex function. Generally, the minimum point can be found by gradient descent method (as shown in Figure 1). The general neural network parameters are up to tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands, so it is difficult to display its optimized terrain directly in three-dimensional space. Through this function, the user can display the optimization space around the neural network training path based on direction reduction and rendering calculation.

## Practice Guidance

The specific use steps are divided into two steps. Taking the classification task as an example, the network is LeNet and the dataset is MNIST. The sample code is as follows:

1. Training data collection: in the training process, use the SummaryCollector to collect the forward network weights of multiple models, the parameters required for landscape drawing (expected drawing interval, landscape resolution, etc.), and other specific use methods of SummaryCollector can be referred to [Collecting Summary Record](https://www.mindspore.cn/mindinsight/docs/en/master/summary_record.html).

   ```

   summary_dir sets the path to save the parameters. summary_collector is the initialized SummaryCollector instance, where collect_landscape in collector_specified_data contains all the parameter settings required for drawing landscape in the form of dictionary:

   - `landscape_size`: It represents the resolution of the landscape. 10 indicates that the resolution of the landscape is 10 * 10. The higher the resolution, the finer the texture of the landscape, and the longer the calculation time will be. Default: 40.
   - `unit`: It represents the interval unit of parameters saved during training, which is divided into `epoch`/`step`. When using `step`, you must set `dataset_sink_model=False` in  `model.train`. Default: `step`
   - `create_landscape`: It represents the way of drawing landscape. At present, it supports training process landscape (with training track) and training result landscape (without track). Default: `{’train‘: True, ’result‘: True}`.
   - `num_samples`: It represents the number of samples in the landscape dataset. 512 indicates that the required sample for the landscape is 512. The larger the number of samples, the more accurate the landscape is, and the longer the calculation time will be. Default: 2048.
   - `intervals`: It represents the section where the landscape is drawn. Such as `interval_1` indicates drawing 1-5 epoch landscape with training track.

2. Landscape drawing: using the model parameters saved in the training process, the model and dataset are consistent with the training, start a new script, and generate landscape information through forward calculation without re-training.

   - `callback_fn`: User needs to define the function `callback_fn`, the function has no input, and returns `model(mindspore.train.Model)`, `network(mindspore.nn.Cell)`, `dataset(mindspore.dataset)`, `metrics(mindspore.train.Metrics)`.
   - `collect_landscape`: The parameter definition is consistent with the `SummaryCollector`, where user can freely modify drawing parameters.
   - `device_ids`: Specify `device_ids` for landscape drawing, which supports single machine multi-device computing.

After drawing, start MindSpore Insight. Refer to [MindSpore Insight Commands](https://www.mindspore.cn/mindinsight/docs/en/master/mindinsight_commands.html) for specific commands.

## Usage Examples Analysis

Here, taking the classification task as an example, the network is ResNet-50 and the dataset is CIFAR-10. Analyse Loss Function Multidimensional Analysis and Loss Graphic Comparison.

![landscape_analysis_train_2.png](./images/landscape_analysis_train_2.png)

Figure 9: ResNet-50 Network 26-40 epoch Isoline Map

As can be seen from Figure 8, at the beginning of training, when the loss scalar curve drops rapidly, the loss trajectory is almost perpendicular to the isoline; As can be seen from Figure 9, at the middle stage of training, the loss curve tends to decline gently, and there are multiple local best points in the Isoline Map. To achieve the tutorial display effect, select as many intervals as possible to better display the effect.

It is mentioned in the paper ([Visualizing the Loss Landscape of Neural Nets](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/file/a41b3bb3e6b050b6c9067c67f663b915-Paper.pdf)) that the smoother the convergence point of the model, the stronger the generalization ability of the model. For ResNet networks with different widths (the width here refers to the number of input and output channels of each block of the network. The larger the number of channels, the wider the model.)

![loss_landscape_result_2](./images/loss_landscape_result_2.png)

Figure 10: Loss Graphic Comparison-3D Map-Overlay-ResNet network overlapped by different widths (top (resnet_interval_1)-widths 4，bottom (resnet_interval_2)-widths 1)

![loss_landscape_result_3](./images/loss_landscape_result_3.png)

Figure 11:  Loss Graphic Comparison-Isoline Map-Comparison of different widths of ResNet network（left-widths 4，right-widths 1）

By comparing the Loss Graph in Figure 10 with that in Figure 11, it can be seen that when training the same epoch, the convergence point of the network with wider width is more flat and broad, and the experiment shows that the generalization ability is also stronger.

## Notices

1. During landscape drawing, the drawing time is directly related to the size of model parameters, dataset `num_sample` and resolution `landscape_size`. The larger model, `num_sample` and `landscape_size`, the longer it takes. For example, for a LeNet network with a resolution of 40 * 40, a landscape takes 4 minutes. When using two devices, the time of a landscape can be reduced to 2 minutes. ResNet-50 network, under the same resolution, 4 devices are used for drawing and calculation, and one landscape takes 20 minutes.
