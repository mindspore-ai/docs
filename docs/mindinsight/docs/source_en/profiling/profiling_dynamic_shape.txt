Dynamic shape iteration analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the training network is a dynamic shape network, the execution time of each operator (including AICPU operator and AICORE operator) during the operation of MindSpore can be statistically displayed by using the operator time-consuming (by iteration) component. It can quickly understand the time fluctuation of each operator in each iteration of training and the shape information of the operator in different iterations.

*Figure: statistics of operator time (by iteration)*

The figure above shows the analysis details of iteration time of different types of operators. You can view the iteration time curve of the specified operator type by filtering the specified operator type (the time shown here is the average time of the execution of different operator types).

*Figure: statistics of operator time-consuming details (by iteration)*

The figure above shows the analysis details of iteration time of different operator instances. By filtering the specified operator name, the iteration time curve of the specified operator instance can be viewed.

*Figure: Shape information of operator (by iteration)*

The figure above shows the shape information of the operator of a specific step. Click the corresponding point of the curve to check the shape information of the specified operator instance.

.. note::
   Dynamic Shape network currently only supports the function modules of operator time (by iteration), operator time statistics ranking, data preparation, timeline, CPU utilization and parallel strategy, but does not support the functions of step trace, flops, memory usage and cluster communication.
