Msprof Tool to Assist Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can collect detailed data of AI Core and HBM/DDR read write rate data and PCIe bandwidth data through profiler, and then analyze and view them through Msprof tool.

The sample code is as follows:

.. code:: python

    profiler = Profiler(output_path='./data', aicore_metrics=1, l2_cache=True, hbm_ddr=True, pcie=True)

aicore_metrics is used to set the AI Core metric type, l2_cache is used to set whether to collect l2 cache data, hbm_ddr is used to set whether to collect HBM/DDR read and write rate data, and pcie is used to set whether to collect PCIe bandwidth data. For parameter details, please refer to the API documentation.

MindSpore Profiler supports the collection of network performance data through the Msprof command line. For details about how to use the Msprof tool to collect and parse network performance data, please refer to the ``Profiling Instructions (Training)`` chapter of the `CANN Development Tools Guide <https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/zh/doc/EDOC1100234052/2c2140b0>`_ document.
