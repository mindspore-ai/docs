Offline Analyse
--------------------

When an error occurs during the training process leading to an abnormal exit, the performance file cannot be fully saved, and the Profiler provides offline parsing functionality.

For example, the partial code of the training script is as follows:

.. code:: python

   class Net(nn.Cell):
       ...


   def train(net):
       ...


   if __name__ == '__main__':
       ms.set_context(mode=ms.GRAPH_MODE, device_target="Ascend")

       # Init Profiler
       # Note that the Profiler should be initialized before model.train
       profiler = ms.Profiler(output_path='/path/to/profiler_data')

       # Train Model
       net = Net()
       train(net)  # Error occur.

       # Profiler end
       profiler.analyse()


If an exception occurs in above code during the training process, resulting in the `profiler.analyse()` at the last line not being executed, the performance data will not be completely parsed. At this point, the offline interface can be used to parse data, and the example code is as follows:

.. code:: python

   from mindspore import Profiler

   profiler.offline_analyse(path='/path/to/profiler_data')


After offline parsing, you can view the profiling data in the directory `/path/to/profiler_data/profile` .
