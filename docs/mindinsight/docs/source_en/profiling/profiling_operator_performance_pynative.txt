Operator Performance Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The operator performance analysis component is used to display the
execution time of the operators(ASCEND/HOSTCPU) during MindSpore
run.

- ASCEND：The operator executed on Ascend. the Ascend operator does not
  distinguish between aicpu and aicore in pynative mode.
- HOSTCPU：The host side CPU is mainly responsible for distributing the
  graph or operator to Ascend chip, and the operator can also be
  developed on the host side CPU according to the actual needs. The
  HOSTCPU operator refers to the operator running on the host side
  CPU.

*Figure:Statistics for Operator Types*

The above figure displays the statistics for the operator types, including:

- Choose pie or bar graph to show the proportion time occupied by each
  operator type. The time of one operator type is calculated by
  accumulating the execution time of operators belonging to this type.
- Display top 20 operator types with the longest execution time, show
  the proportion and execution time (ms) of each operator type.

*Figure:Statistics for Operators*

The above figure displays the statistics table for the operators, including:

- Choose All: Display statistics for the operators, including operator
  name, type, execution time, subgraph, full name. The
  table will be sorted by execution time by default.
- Choose Type: Display statistics for the operator types, including
  operator type name, execution time, execution frequency and
  proportion of total time. Users can click on each line, querying for
  all the operators belonging to this type.
- Search: There is a search box on the right, which can support fuzzy
  search for operators/operator types.
