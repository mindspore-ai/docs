Timeline (Large model scenario, multi-ranks, multi-graphs, multi-iterations) Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Timeline Features:

- This feature is designed for the comparison and analysis of large model scenarios with multiple cards, iterations,
  and graphs.
- Inspired by Nsight, it was first proposed to split data into two parts: summary and detail.
  The summary is positioned to showcase the overall execution of the model, while the detail is positioned
  to showcase the API level execution of the network.
- The summary data include: step trace, overlap analysis of communication and computation;
  The detail data include: except for summary data, the execution order of calculation operators
  and communication operators.
- Support filtering and merging data based on card number (rank id).
- Support filtering and merging data based on multiple graphs (graph id).

How to view the timeline:

- 1. Click on the download button in the Timeline section of the overview page,
  download the timeline data(json format) locally.

    . figure:: ./images/timeline_option.png
       :alt: timeline_option.png

    *Figure：Timeline download page*

    As shown in the figure above:

    - ranks: used for filtering and merging, default to all.
    - subgraphs: used for filtering subgraphs, default to all.
    - data kind: choice summary or detail, default to summary.
    - merge multiple subgraphs: whether to merge the iteration trajectory data of multiple subgraphs.

- 2. Open `perfetto <https://ui.perfetto.dev/>` website, drag the downloaded timeline data onto the
  page to complete the display.

    *Figure：Timeline（2 ranks）Analysis*

    As shown in the figure above:

    - Step Trace: Display the forward and backward time and iteration trailing time
      of each iteration according to the dimension of graph and iteration.
    - Overlap Analysis: Including total network computing time, communication time,
      communication time not covered by computation, and card idle time.
    - Ascend Hardware: Display the execution order of device side calculation operators and communication
      operators according to the stream.
    - HCCL: Display the execution order of communication operators according to the plane.

Recommended usage of perfetto:

- W/A/S/D can be applied to zoom in and out of the Timeline graph.
- Select any event block, can view the detailed information of this block in the pop-up details bar below.
- Mouse over multiple event blocks, can compare and analyze the execution time of multiple event blocks
  in the pop-up details bar below.


How to use timeline to solve practical problems：

- Step 1. Firstly, we recommend filtering and download summary data containing all ranks and graphs,
  Identify performance bottlenecks based on overall network execution to avoid premature optimization.
- Step 2. Then, by filtering and downloading detailed data for certain ranks and graphs,
  further identify performance bottlenecks at the API level and identify optimization points.
- Step 3. After optimizing the code, repeat the step 1 and 2 above until the performance meets the requirements.
