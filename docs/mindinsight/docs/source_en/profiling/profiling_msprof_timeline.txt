Timeline Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Timeline Features:

- This feature is designed for the comparison and analysis of large model scenarios with multiple cards, iterations,
  and graphs.
- Inspired by Nsight, it was first proposed to split data into two parts: summary and detail.
  The summary is positioned to showcase the overall execution of the model, while the detail is positioned
  to showcase the API level execution of the network.
- The summary data include: step trace, overlap analysis of communication and computation;
  The detail data include: except for summary data, the execution order of calculation operators
  and communication operators.
- Support filtering and merging data based on card number (rank id).
- Support filtering and merging data based on multiple graphs (graph id).

How to view the timeline:

1. Click on the download button in the Timeline section of the overview page,
   download the timeline data(json format) locally.

   .. figure:: ./images/timeline_option.png
      :alt: timeline_option.png

   *Figure: Timeline download page*

   As shown in the figure above:

   - ranks: used for filtering and merging, default to all.
   - subgraphs: used for filtering subgraphs, default to all.
   - data kind: choice summary or detail, default to summary.
   - merge multiple subgraphs: whether to merge the iteration trajectory data of multiple subgraphs.

2. Open `perfetto <https://ui.perfetto.dev/>`_ website, drag the downloaded timeline data onto the
   page to complete the display.

   .. figure:: ./images/timeline_detail.png

   *Figure: Timeline (2 ranks) Analysis*

   As shown in the figure above:

   - Step Trace: Display the forward and backward time and iteration trailing time
     of each iteration according to the dimension of graph and iteration.
   - Overlap Analysis: Including total network computing time, communication time,
     communication time not covered by computation, and card idle time.
   - Ascend Hardware: Display the execution order of device side calculation operators and communication
     operators according to the stream.
   - HCCL: Display the execution order of communication operators according to the plane.

Recommended usage of perfetto:

- W/A/S/D can be applied to zoom in and out of the Timeline graph.
- Select any event block, can view the detailed information of this block in the pop-up details bar below.
- Mouse over multiple event blocks, can compare and analyze the execution time of multiple event blocks
  in the pop-up details bar below.


How to use timeline to solve practical problems:

1. Firstly, we recommend filtering and download summary data containing all ranks and graphs,
   identify performance bottlenecks based on overall network execution to avoid premature optimization.
2. Then, by filtering and downloading detailed data for certain ranks and graphs,
   further identify performance bottlenecks at the API level and identify optimization points.
3. After optimizing the code, repeat the step 1 and 2 above until the performance meets the requirements.
