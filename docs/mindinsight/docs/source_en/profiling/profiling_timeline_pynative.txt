Timeline Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Timeline component can display:

- The operators (ASCEND/HOSTCPU operators) are executed on which
  device.
- The MindSpore thread split strategy for this neural network.
- The execution sequence and execution time of the operator on the
  device.
- The step number of training (Only supports dataset sinking mode.).
- ``Scope Name`` of the operator, the number of each operator’s
  ``Scope Name`` could be selected and download corresponding timeline
  file. For example, the full name of one operator is
  ``Default/network/lenet5/Conv2D-op11``, thus the first ``Scope Name``
  of this operator is ``Default``, the second ``Scope Name`` is
  ``network``. If two ``Scope Name`` for each operator is selected,
  then the ``Default`` and ``network`` will be displayed.

By analyzing the timeline, users can locate an operator and view and analyze its execution time.
Click the download button on the overall performance page to
view Timeline details. The Timeline data file (json format) will be
stored on local machine, and can be displayed by tools. We suggest to
use ``chrome://tracing`` or
`Perfetto <https://ui.perfetto.dev/#!viewer>`__ to visualize the
Timeline.

- Chrome tracing: Click “load” on the upper left to load the file.
- Perfetto: Click “Open trace file” on the left to load the file.

*Figure:Timeline Analysis*

The Timeline consists of the following parts:

- Device and Stream List: It will show the stream list on each device.
  Each stream consists of a series of tasks. One rectangle stands for
  one task, and the area stands for the execution time of the task.
  Each color block represents the starting time and length of operator
  execution. The detailed explanation of timeline is as follows:

  - Step: the number of training steps.
  - Ascend Op: contains the timeline of operators executed
    on the Ascend.
  - HOSTCPU Op: contains the timeline of operators executed
    on the HOSTCPU.

- The Operator Information: When we click one task, the corresponding
  operator of this task will be shown at the bottom.

W/A/S/D can be applied to zoom in and out of the Timeline graph.
