Operator Performance Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The operator performance analysis component is used to display the
execution time of the operators(AICORE/AICPU/HOSTCPU) during MindSpore
run.

- AICORE：AI Core operator is the main component of the computing core
  of Ascend AI processor, which is responsible for executing vector and
  tensor related computation intensive operators. TBE (Tensor Boost
  Engine) is an extended operator development tool based on TVM (Tensor
  Virtual Machine) framework. Users can use TBE to register AI Core
  operator information.
- AICPU：AI CPU operator is a kind of CPU operator (including control
  operator, scalar, vector and other general-purpose calculations) that
  AI CPU is responsible for executing Hisilicon SOC in Ascend
  processor. The same operator in MindSpore may have AI Core operator
  and AI CPU operator at the same time. The framework will give
  priority to AI Core operator. If there is no AI Core operator or the
  selection is not satisfied, AI CPU operator will be called.
- HOSTCPU：The host side CPU is mainly responsible for distributing the
  graph or operator to Ascend chip, and the operator can also be
  developed on the host side CPU according to the actual needs. The
  host CPU operator refers to the operator running on the host side
  CPU.

*Figure:Statistics for Operator Types*

The above figure displays the statistics for the operator types, including:

- Choose pie or bar graph to show the proportion time occupied by each
  operator type. The time of one operator type is calculated by
  accumulating the execution time of operators belonging to this type.
- Display top 20 operator types with the longest execution time, show
  the proportion and execution time (us) of each operator type.

*Figure:Statistics for Operators*

The above figure displays the statistics table for the operators, including:

- Choose All: Display statistics for the operators, including operator
  name, type, average execution time, execution frequency, full scope time, information, etc.
  The table will be sorted by execution time by default.
- Choose Type: Display statistics for the operator types, including
  operator type name, execution time, execution frequency and
  proportion of total time. Users can click on each line, querying for
  all the operators belonging to this type.
- Search: There is a search box on the right, which can support fuzzy
  search for operators/operator types.
