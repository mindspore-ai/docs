Calculation quantity analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Calculation Quantity Analysis module shows the actual calculation
quantity data, including calculation quantity data for operator
granularity and model granularity. The actual
calculation quantity refers to the amount of calculation that is running
on the device, which is different from the theoretical calculation
quantity. For example, the matrix computing unit on the Ascend910 device
is dealing with a matrix of 16x16 size, so in the runtime, the original
matrix will be padded to 16x16. Only calculation quantity on AICORE
devices is supported currently. The information about calculation
quantity has four indicators:

- FLOPs(cube): the number of cube floating point operations (the unit is
  million).
- FLOPS(cube): the number of cube floating point operations per second (the unit
  is billion).
- FLOPs(vec): the number of vector floating point operations (the unit is
  million).
- FLOPS(vec): the number of vector floating point operations per second (the unit
  is billion).
