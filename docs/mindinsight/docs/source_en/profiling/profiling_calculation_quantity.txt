Calculation quantity analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Calculation Quantity Analysis module shows the actual calculation
quantity data, including calculation quantity data for operator
granularity, scope level granularity, and model granularity. The actual
calculation quantity refers to the amount of calculation that is running
on the device, which is different from the theoretical calculation
quantity. For example, the matrix computing unit on the Ascend910 device
is dealing with a matrix of 16x16 size, so in the runtime, the original
matrix will be padded to 16x16. Only calculation quantity on AICORE
devices is supported currently. The information about calculation
quantity has three indicators:

- FLOPs: the number of floating point operations（the unit is
  million）.
- FLOPS: the number of floating point operations per second (the unit
  is billion).
- FLOPS utilization: obtained by dividing the FLOPS by the peak FLOPS of the
  AICORE device (The calculation of FLOPS utilization depends on the step division.
  If the step division is not accurate, this value will be inaccurate).

*Figure:Calculation Quantity Analysis*

The red box in figure above includes calculation quantity data on operator
granularity, scope level granularity, and model granularity. Click the
“details” to see the scope level calculation quantity data.

*Figure:Scope Level FLOPs*

Figure above is a sankey diagram that presents data in the structure of a
tree where the cursor selects a scope to see the specific FLOPs value.

.. note::
   This figure only draws the Scope hierarchy structure of the operator
   (the specific name of the operator at the last layer is not shown).
   Since the depth of each operator’s hierarchy is not equal in the
   training process, it may occur that the sum of time of adjacent
   levels is not equal.
