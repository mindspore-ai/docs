Timeline Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Timeline component can display:

- The operators (AICORE/AICPU/HOSTCPU operators) are executed on which
  device.
- The MindSpore stream split strategy for this neural network.
- The execution sequence and execution time of the operator on the
  device.
- The step number of training (Currently dynamic shape scene,
  multi-graph scene and heterogeneous training scene are not supported,
  steps data may be inaccurate in these scene.).
- ``Scope Name`` of the operator, the number of each operator’s
  ``Scope Name`` could be selected and download corresponding timeline
  file. For example, the full name of one operator is
  ``Default/network/lenet5/Conv2D-op11``, thus the first ``Scope Name``
  of this operator is ``Default``, the second ``Scope Name`` is
  ``network``. If two ``Scope Name`` for each operator is selected,
  then the ``Default`` and ``network`` will be displayed.

Users can get the most detailed information from the Timeline:

- From the High level, users can analyse whether the stream split
  strategy can be optimized and whether the step tail is too long.
- From the Low level, users can analyse the execution time for all the
  operators, etc.

Users can click the download button on the overall performance page to
view Timeline details. The Timeline data file (json format) will be
stored on local machine, and can be displayed by tools. We suggest to
use ``chrome://tracing`` or
`Perfetto <https://ui.perfetto.dev/#!viewer>`__ to visualize the
Timeline.

- Chrome tracing: Click “load” on the upper left to load the file.
- Perfetto: Click “Open trace file” on the left to load the file.

*Figure:Timeline Analysis*

The Timeline consists of the following parts:

- Device and Stream List: It will show the stream list on each device.
  Each stream consists of a series of tasks. One rectangle stands for
  one task, and the area stands for the execution time of the task.

  Each color block represents the starting time and length of operator
  execution. The detailed explanation of timeline is as follows:

  - Process Device ID: contains the timeline of operators executed on
    AI Core.

    - Step: the number of training steps.
    - Scope Name: the Scope Name of operators.
    - Stream #ID: operators executed on the stream.

  - Process AI CPU Op: the timeline of operators executed on the AI
    CPU.
  - Process Communication Op: the timeline for the execution of
    communication operators.
  - Process Host CPU Op: contains the timeline of operators executed
    on the Host CPU.
  - Process Op Overlap Analyse: the timeline of all computation
    operators and communication operators merged, it can be used to
    analyse the proportion of communication time.

    - Merged Computation Op: it is the timeline after all computation
      operators are merged.
    - Merged Communication Op: it is the timeline after all
      communication operators are merged.
    - Pure Communication Op: pure communication time (the timeline of
      the communication operator after removing the overlap with the
      computation operator time).
    - Free Time: there is no communication operator and calculation
      operator in the execution timeline.

- The Operator Information: When we click one task, the corresponding
  operator of this task will be shown at the bottom.

W/A/S/D can be applied to zoom in and out of the Timeline graph.
