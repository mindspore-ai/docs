Operation Process
-----------------

- Prepare a training script, add profiler APIs in the training script
  and run the training script.
- Start MindInsight and specify the summary-base-dir using startup
  parameters, note that summary-base-dir is the parent directory of the
  directory created by Profiler. For example, the directory created by
  Profiler is ``/home/user/code/data/``, the summary-base-dir should be
  ``/home/user/code``. After MindInsight is started, access the
  visualization page based on the IP address and port number. The
  default access IP address is ``http://127.0.0.1:8080``.
- Find the training in the list, click the performance profiling link
  and view the data on the web page.
