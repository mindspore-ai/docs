--------------

- To limit the data size generated by the Profiler, MindInsight
  suggests that for large neural network, the profiled steps should be
  less than 10.
  
  .. note::
     The number of steps can be controlled by controlling the size of
     training dataset. For example, the ``num_samples`` parameter in
     ``mindspore.dataset.MindDataset`` can control the size of the
     dataset. For details, please refer to:
     https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/api/en/master/api_python/dataset/mindspore.dataset.MindDataset.html

- The parse of Timeline data is time consuming, and usually the data of
  a few steps is enough to analyze the results. In order to speed up
  the data parse and UI display, Profiler will show at most 20M data
  (Contain 10+ step information for large networks).
