## Overview

Recent years, deep reinforcement learning is developing by leaps and bounds, new algorithms come out every year. To offer high scalability and reuable reinforcement framework, MindSpore RL separates an algorithm into several parts, such as Actor, Learner, Policy, Environment, ReplayBuffer, etc. Moreover, due to the complexity of deep reinforcement learning algorithm, its performance is largely influenced by different hyper-parameters. MindSpore RL provides centeral configuration API, which decouples the algorithm from deployment and execution considerations to help users adjust model and algorithm conveniently.

This instruction uses DQN algorithm as an example to introduce how to use this configuration API, and help users customize their algorithms.

You can obtain the code of DQN algorithm from [https://gitee.com/mindspore/reinforcement/tree/r0.2/example/dqn](https://gitee.com/mindspore/reinforcement/tree/r0.2/example/dqn).

## Configuration Details

MindSpore RL uses `algorithm_config` to define each algorithm component and corresponding hyper-parameters. `algorithm_config` is a Python dictionary, which describes actor, learner, policy and environment respectively. Framework can arrange the execution and deployment, which means that user only needs to focus on the algorithm design.

The following code defines a set of algorithm configurations and uses `algorithm_config` to create a `Session`. `Session` is responsible for allocating resources and executing computational graph compilation and execution.

```python
from mindspore_rl.mindspore_rl import Session
algorithm_config = {
    'actor': {...},
    'learner': {...},
    'policy_and_network': {...},
    'environment': {...},
    'eval_environment': {...}
}

session = Session(algorithm_config)
session.run(...)
```

Each parameter and their instruction in algorithm_config will be described below.

### Policy Configuration

Policy is usually used to determine the behaviour (or action) that agent will execute in the next step, it takes `type` and `params` as the subitems.

- `type` : specify the name of Policy, Actor determines the action through Policy. In deep reinforcement learning, Policy usually uses deep neural network to extract the feature of environment, and outputs the action in the next step.
- `params` : specify the parameter that used during creating the instance of Policy. One thing should be noticed is that `type` and `params` need to be matched.

```python
from dqn.src.dqn import DQNPolicy

policy_params = {
    'epsi_high': 0.1,        # epsi_high/epsi_low/decay control the proportion of exploitation and exploration
    'epsi_low': 0.1,         # epsi_high：the highest probability of exploration，epsi_low：the lowest probability of exploration，
    'decay': 200,            # decay：the step decay
    'lr': 0.001,             # learning rate
    'state_space_dim': 0,    # the dimension of state space，0 means that it will read from the environment automatically
    'action_space_dim': 0,   # the dimension of action space，0 means that it will read from the environment automatically
    'hidden_size': 100,      # the dimension of hidden layer
}

algorithm_config = {
    ...
    'policy_and_network': {
        'type': DQNPolicy,
        'params': policy_params,
    },
    ...
}
```

|  key   |        Type        |                  Range                  |                         Description                          |
| :----: | :----------------: | :-------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|  type  |       Class        |         The user-defined class          |      This type is the same name as user-defined class.       |
| params | Dictionary or None | Any value with key value format or None | Customized parameter, user can input any value with key value format. If it does not need parameter, fill None. |

### Environment Configuration

`Env` states for the environment, it takes `type` and `params` as the subitems.

- `type` : specify the name of environment, which could be either environment from MindSpore RL, such as `GymEnvironment` or user defined environment.
- `params` : specify the parameter that used during creating the instance of environment. One thing should be noticed is that `type` and `params` need to be matched.

The following example defines the configuration of environment. Framework will create a`CartPole-v0` environment like `Environment(name='CartPole-v0')` .

```python
from mindspore_rl.environment import Environment
env_params = {'name': 'CartPole-v0'}
algorithm_config = {
    ...
    'env': {
        'type': GymEnvironment,            # the class name of environment
        'params': env_params               # parameter of environment
    }
    ...
}
```

| :---------------: | :----------------: | :-------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| number (optional) |      Integer       |                 [1, +∞)                 | If the type is GymEnvironment, then user does not need to fill number. If the type MultiGymEnvironment, user needs to fill the number of environment. |
|       type        |       Class        |  GymEnvironment or MultiGymEnvironment  |                The class name of environment                 |
|      params       | Dictionary or None | Any value with key value format or None | Customized parameter, user can input any value with key value format. If it does not need parameter, fill None. |

### Actor Configuration

`Actor` is charge of interacting with environment. Generally, `Actor` interacts with `Env` through `Policy`. Some algorithms will store the experience which obtained during the interaction into `ReplayBuffer`. Therefore, `Actor` will take `Policy` , `Environment` and `ReplayBuffer`. In Actor configuration, `policies`  and `networks` need to specify the name of member variable in `Policy`.

The following code defines the configuration of  `DQNActor` . Framework will create the instance of Actor like `DQNActor(algorithm_config['actor'])`.

```python
algorithm_config = {
    ...
    'actor': {
        'number': 1,                                                        # the number of Actor
        'type': DQNActor,                                                   # the class name of Actor
        'params': None,                                                     # the parameter of Actor
        'policies': ['init_policy', 'collect_policy', 'eval_policy'],       # Take the policies that called init_policy, collect_policy and eval_policy in Policy class as input to create the instance of actor
        'networks': ['policy_net', 'target_net'],                           # Take the networks that called policy_net and target_net in Policy class as input to create the instance of actor
        'environment': True,                                                # take the object of environment to create the instance of actor
        'eval_environment': True,                                           # take the object of eval environment to create the instance of actor
        'replay_buffer': {'capacity': 100000,                               # the capacity of ReplayBuffer
                   'sample_size': 64,                                       # sample Batch Size
                   'shape': [(4,), (1,), (1,), (4,)],                       # the dimension info of ReplayBuffer
                   'type': [ms.float32, ms.int32, ms.float32, ms.float32]}, # the data type of ReplayBuffer
    }
    ...
}
```

### Learner Configuration

`Learner` is used to update the weights of neural network according to experience. `Learner` holds the DNN which is defined in `Policy` (the name of member variable in `Policy` match with the contains in `networks`), which is used to calculate the loss and update the weights of neural network.

The following code defines the configuration of `DQNLearner` . Framework will create the instance of Learner like `DQNLearner(algorithm_config['learner'])`.

```python
from dqn.src.dqn import DQNLearner
learner_params = {'gamma': 0.99}  
algorithm_config = {
    ...
    'learner': {
        'number': 1,                                    # the number of Learner
        'type': DQNLearner,                             # the class name of Learner
        'params': learner_params                        # the decay rate
        'networks': ['target_net', 'policy_net_train']  # Learner takes the target_net and policy_net_train from Policy as input argument to update the network
    },
    ...
}
```
