## Overview

Different parameters usually need to be configured during the training and inference process of a model. MindSpore Transformers supports the use of `YAML` files to centrally manage and adjust the configurable items, which makes the configuration of the model more structured and improves its maintainability at the same time.

## Description of the YAML File Contents

The `YAML` file provided by MindSpore Transformers contains configuration items for different functions, which are described below according to their contents.

### Basic Configuration

The basic configuration is mainly used to specify MindSpore random seeds and related settings for loading weights.

### Parallel Configuration

In order to improve the performance of the model, it is usually necessary to configure the parallelism strategy for the model in large-scale cluster usage scenarios. For details, please refer to [Distributed Parallelism](https://www.mindspore.cn/mindformers/docs/en/r1.5.0/function/distributed_parallel.html), the parallel configuration in MindSpore Transformers is as follows.

The number of sublists in the list must be equal to the length of `train_dataset.input_columns`. Each sublist in the list must have the same shape as the data returned by the dataset. Generally, data parallel splitting is done along the first dimension, so the first dimension of the sublist should be configured to match `data_parallel`, while the other dimensions should be set to `1`.
