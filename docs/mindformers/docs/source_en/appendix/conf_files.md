## Overview

Different parameters usually need to be configured during the training and inference process of a model. MindSpore Transformers supports the use of `YAML` files to centrally manage and adjust the configurable items, which makes the configuration of the model more structured and improves its maintainability at the same time.

## Description of the YAML File Contents

The `YAML` file provided by MindSpore Transformers contains configuration items for different functions, which are described below according to their contents.

### Basic Configuration

The basic configuration is mainly used to specify MindSpore random seeds and related settings for loading weights.
