    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum chemistry refers to solving the numerical values of the time-dependent or time-independent Schrödinger equations by using the basic theory and method of quantum mechanics. Quantum chemical simulation on high-performance computers has become an important method to study the physical and chemical properties of materials. However, the exact solution of the Schrödinger equation has exponential complexity, which severely constrains the scale of the chemical system that can be simulated. The development of quantum computing in recent years provides a feasible way to solve this problem. It is expected that the Schrödinger equation can be solved with high accuracy on quantum computers under the complexity of polynomials.\n",

In general, the solution of time-dependent Schrödinger equation is more complex, so Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BO approximation) is introduced. In BO approximation, the mass of the nucleus is far greater than that of electrons, and the velocity of the nucleus is far lower than that of electrons. Therefore, the nucleus and electrons can be separated from each other, and the time-independent electron motion equation (also called the time-independent Schrödinger equation) can be obtained as follows:\n",

These three methods belong to the wave function. Before starting the computing, first make a brief introduction to these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wave Function\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the methods to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation is the [Hartree-Fock (HF)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1935.0085) method, which was proposed by Hartree et al. in the 1930s and is the basic method in quantum chemistry computing. The HF method introduces a single determinant approximation, that is, a wave function of the $N$-electronic system is represented by a wave function in a determinant form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "| \\Psi \\rangle = | \\psi_{1} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{3} \\dots \\psi_{N} \\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $| \\psi_{1} \\psi_{2} \\psi_{3} \\dots \\rangle$ represents the Nth-order determinants formed by a set of spin-orbit wave functions $\\{ \\pi_{i} \\}$.\n",
    "The spin-orbit wave function $\\psi_{i}$ may be further expanded with a set of basis functions in known forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\psi_{i} = \\phi_{i} \\eta_{i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi_{i} = \\sum_{\\mu}{C_{\\mu i} \\chi_{\\mu}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\{\\chi_{\\mu}\\}$ is referred to as a basis function, and may be a Gaussian function or the like.\n",
    "This approximation considers the exchange between electrons, but neglects the correlation between electrons, so it cannot correctly compute the properties such as dissociation energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The improvement of the HF method can be derived from the wave function expansion theorem. The wave function expansion theorem can be expressed as follows: if $\\{ \\psi_{i} \\}$ is a complete set of spin-orbit wave functions, the $N$-electronic system wave function may be accurately expanded by a determinant wave function formed by $\\{ \\psi_{i} \\}$:\n",

A CI that considers only single excitation and double excitation is called a configuration interaction with singles and doubles (CISD). The CI that takes into account all the ground-state HF wave functions to N excitation wave functions is called full configuration interaction (FCI). The FCI wave function is the exact solution of the time-independent Schrödinger equation under the given basis function.\n",

It is easy to know from the Taylor's expansion of the exponent that even if the coupled-cluster operator $\\hat{T}$ includes only a low-order excitation term, the $\\exp{(\\hat{T})}$ may also implicitly include a high-order excitation term. This also makes a convergence speed of the CC method to the FCI wave function much faster than that of the CI. For truncation to K excitation, for example, K=2, the accuracy of the CCSD exceeds that of the CISD.\n",

In addition, it is easy to find that the computing volume of FCI is much greater than that of CCSD and HF. The `MolecularData` function encapsulated by OpenFermion and the `run_pyscf` function encapsulated by OpenFermion-PySCF are used for demonstration."
