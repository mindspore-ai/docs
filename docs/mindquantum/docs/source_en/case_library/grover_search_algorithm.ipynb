    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have heard of quantum computing, you must have heard of the Grover search algorithm. In 1996, Lov Grover \\[1\\] proposed the Grover search algorithm, which is an algorithm that uses the superposition of quantum states to perform parallel computing and achieve acceleration. The Grover search algorithm is recognized as the second great quantum algorithm after Shor algorithm, and it is also the first quantum algorithm to be fully experimentally implemented, which solves the problem of unordered database search. In 1997, Bennett \\[2\\] et al. proved that for the unstructured quantum search problem, at least $\\Omega(\\sqrt{N})$ quantum queries are required, so the Grover search algorithm is the optimal algorithm in the asymptotic sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Unordered Database Search problem is to find some elements that meet the requirements from an unordered database with a large number of elements. Since the number of elements in the database is huge and the elements are unordered, it is easy to verify that a given element satisfies the requirements, but conversely, it is not easy to find these elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the unordered database search problem (it may be assumed that there is only one target search data), the time complexity required by the classical algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, while the time complexity required by the Grover search algorithm is only $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$, compared with the classical algorithm, it has a quadratic speedup, showing the powerful performance of quantum computing. In addition, the amplitude expansion technique used in Grover search algorithm can accelerate many heuristic classical search algorithms, so it has a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will introduce the basic principles of Grover search algorithm, and show how to use MindSpore Quantum to implement the algorithm by two specific simple examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to search in an unordered set of $N$ elements (database). Establish one-to-one correspondence between elements in the database and indexes (integers from $0$ to $N-1$), and we focus on searching the indices of these elements. Consider formulating this search problem as a function $f(x)$ over an input $x$, where $x$ is an integer between $0$ and $N-1$. Then, the function $f$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f(x)=\\begin{cases}0,x\\neq x_{target}\\\\\\\\\n",
    "1,x=x_{target}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without loss of generality, assuming $N=2^n$, then in a quantum system, the index is in the quantum state $|0\\rangle,|1\\rangle,...,|N-1\\rangle$ (or $|00...0\\rangle,|00...1\\rangle,...,|11...1\\rangle$), that is, we can use $n$ qubits to store these indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, it is assumed that the search problem has only one target state $|\\omega\\rangle$. The goal of Grover search algorithm is to search for $|\\omega\\rangle$ with great probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fundamentals of Grover Search Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic principle of Grover search algorithm: First, a uniform superposition state is generated by the [Hadamard](https://www.mindspore.cn/mindquantum/docs/en/master/core/gates/mindquantum.core.gates.HGate.html) gate, and then the Grover iteration (or $G$ operator) is repeatedly called to amplify the probability amplitude of the target item and suppress the probability amplitude of the non-target item (this method is called is the amplitude amplification), and finally the final state is measured, so that the target state $|\\omega\\rangle$ can be obtained with great probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Grover search algorithm mainly includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Database Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the $H^{\\otimes n}$ operation on $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$, so that the database is initially in a uniform superposition state, that is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |\\psi_0\\rangle=H^{\\otimes n}|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}|i\\rangle. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Grover Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Grover iteration can be further decomposed into four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SubStep One\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the Oracle Operator $U_{\\omega}$, and flip the phase of the target state $|\\omega \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to distinguish the data to be found from other data, the easiest way is to flip the phase of the target state (add a negative sign). At this time, we need to construct an Oracle operator $U_{\\omega}$, which works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "U_{\\omega}|x\\rangle=\\begin{cases}\n",
    "&|x\\rangle,x\\neq \\omega&\\\\\\\\\n",
    "-&|x\\rangle,x=\\omega&\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since when $x=\\omega$, $f(\\omega)=1$, the effect of $U_{\\omega}$ can also be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U_{\\omega}|x\\rangle=(-1)^{f(x)}|x\\rangle, $$\n",

    "$$ G = H^{\\otimes n} [2(|0\\rangle\\langle0|)^{\\otimes n} - I_n] H^{\\otimes n} U_{\\omega}. $$\n",

    "### Step 3: Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing $\\{|0\\rangle,|1\\rangle\\}$ basis measurements on the final state, the target state $|\\omega \\rangle$ can be obtained with great probability.\n",

    "## Constructing a Unitary Operator that Flips the Phase of a Qubit\n",
    "\n",
    "By the above introduction, we found that the most critical part of the Grover search algorithm is that there is a unitary operator that can flip the phase of the qubit, the Oracle operator $U_{\\omega}$ can flip the phase of the target state, and the conditional phase shift operator $P$ can flip the phase of every state except $|0\\rangle$ state.\n",
