## Confirming System Environment Information

- The hardware platform should be Linux CPU with avx supported.
- Refer to [MindSpore Installation Guide](https://www.mindspore.cn/install/en), install MindSpore, version 1.2.0 or later is required.
- See [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindquantum/blob/r0.3/setup.py) for the remaining dependencies.

## Installation Methods

You can install MindInsight either by pip or by source code.

### Install by pip

```bash
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/{ms_version}/MindQuantum/any/mindquantum-{mq_version}-py3-none-any.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

> - When the network is connected, dependency items are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. (For details about other dependency items, see [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindquantum/blob/r0.3/setup.py)). In other cases, you need to manually install dependency items.
> - `{ms_version}` refers to the MindSpore version that matches with MindQuantum. For example, if you want to install MindQuantum 0.3.0, then,`{ms_version}` should be 1.5.0。
> - `{mq_version}` denotes the version of MindQuantum. For example, when you are downloading MindQuantum 0.3.0, `{version}` should be 0.3.0.
> - Refers to [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/versions) to find different version of packages。
