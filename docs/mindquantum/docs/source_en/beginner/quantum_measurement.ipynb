    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the design of quantum circuits, we finally need to obtain the results through the measurement operation. When measuring, we need to select a specific ground state for measurement,  the measured results are uncertain, and the quantum state will also randomly collapse to at some ground state we measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum measurement is described by a set of measurement operators ${M_m}$, these operators act on the state space of the system under test, the index $m$ represents the possible measurement results in the experiment, if before the measurement, the state of the quantum system is $ |\\psi⟩$, then the probability of occurrence of the result $m$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(m)=⟨\\psi|M^\\dagger_mM_m|\\psi⟩\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The state collapse of the system after measurement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{M_m|\\psi⟩}{\\sqrt{⟨\\psi|M^\\dagger_mM_m|\\psi⟩}}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "The measurement operator satisfies the completeness equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Sigma_mM^\\dagger_mM_m=I\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The completeness equation expresses the fact that the probabilities sum to 1:\n",

    "1=\\Sigma_m p(m)=\\Sigma_m ⟨\\psi|M^\\dagger_mM_m|\\psi⟩\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation holds for all $|\\psi⟩$ and is equivalent to the completeness equation, but it is simpler to directly verify the completeness equation, so the completeness equation is used as a constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the different measurement operators selected, our common measurements are divided into  computational basis measurement, projection measurement, Pauli measurement, etc. MindSpore Quantum provides a wealth of measurement functions and visual display tools, and we use these functions to further learn quantum measurement."

    "We first have a simple understanding of the calculation basis measurement: suppose there is a state of n qubits, we perform n-bit calculation basis measurement on it. After the measurement, if the result is $00 \\cdots0$, it indicates that the quantum of the n-qubit system has collapsed to the $|00 \\cdots0⟩$ state; similarly, if one of the qubits is measured, half of the $2^n$cases it represents are excluded, i.e. the measurement operation projects the quantum state onto one of the two halves of the space, indicating that a subsystem of the quantum state of the n-qubit system has collapsed.\n",
