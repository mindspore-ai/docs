MindSpore environment variables are as follows:

| Environment Variable | Module | Function | Type | Value Range | Configuration Relationship | Mandatory or Not | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

|MS_GRAPH_KERNEL_FLAGS|MindSpore|Control options of graph kernel fusion, it can be used to open or close the graph kernel fusion, supports fine-tune of several optimizations in graph kernel fusion and supports dumping the fusion process, which is helpful in problems location and performance tuning.|String|Refer to the value setting of [graph_kernel_flags](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/api/en/r1.3/api_python/mindspore.context.html#mindspore.context.set_context) in mindspore/context.py<br>Note: The priority of environment variables is higher than context, that is, if both environment variables and context are set at the same time, only the settings in the environment variables will take effect.|None|Optional|None|
|RANK_TABLE_FILE|MindSpore|Specifies the file to which a path points, including `DEVICE_IP`s corresponding to multiple Ascend AI Processor `DEVICE_ID`s. |String|File path, which can be a relative path or an absolute path.|This variable is used together with RANK_SIZE. |Optional (when the Ascend AI Processor is used, specified by user when a distributed case is executed)|None|
|RANK_SIZE|MindSpore|Specifies the number of Ascend AI Processors to be called during deep learning. |Integer|The number of Ascend AI Processors to be called ranges from 1 to 8. | This variable is used together with RANK_TABLE_FILE |Optional (when the Ascend AI Processor is used, specified by user when a distributed case is executed) |None|
|RANK_ID|MindSpore|Specifies the logical ID of the Ascend AI Processor called during deep learning.|Integer|The value ranges from 0 to 7. When multiple servers are running concurrently, `DEVICE_ID`s in different servers may be the same. RANK_ID can be used to avoid this problem. (RANK_ID = SERVER_ID * DEVICE_NUM + DEVICE_ID) |None|Optional|None|
|MS_SUBMODULE_LOG_v|MindSpore| For details about the function and usage, see [MS_SUBMODULE_LOG_v](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/programming_guide/en/r1.3/custom_debugging_info.html#log-related-environment-variables-and-configurations)|Dict{String:Integer...}|LogLevel: 0-DEBUG, 1-INFO, 2-WARNING, 3-ERROR<br>SubModual: COMMON, MD, DEBUG, DEVICE, COMMON, IR...|None | Optional|None|
|OPTION_PROTO_LIB_PATH|MindSpore|Specifies the RPOTO dependent library path. |String|File path, which can be a relative path or an absolute path.|None|Optional|None|
|MS_RDR_ENABLE|MindSpore|Determines whether to enable running data recorder (RDR). If a running exception occurs in MindSpore, the pre-recorded data in MindSpore is automatically exported to assist in locating the cause of the running exception.|Integer|1：enables RDR <br>0：disables RDR|This variable is used together with MS_RDR_PATH|Optional|None|
|MS_RDR_PATH|MindSpore|Specifies the system path for storing the data recorded by running data recorder (RDR).|String|Directory path, which should be an absolute path.|This variable is used together with MS_RDR_ENABLE=1|Optional|None|
|MS_OM_PATH|MindSpore|Specifies the save path for the file(analyze_fail.dat) which is dumped if a compiling graph error occurred.|String|File path, which can be a relative path or an absolute path.|None|Optional|None|
|MS_ENABLE_CACHE|MindData|Determines whether to enable the cache function for datasets during data processing to accelerate dataset reading and argumentation processing. |String|TRUE: enables the cache function during data processing. <br>FALSE: disables the cache function during data processing. | This variable is used together with MS_CACHE_HOST and MS_CACHE_PORT. |Optional|None|
|MS_CACHE_HOST|MindData|Specifies the IP address of the host where the cache server is located when the cache function is enabled. |String|IP address of the host where the cache server is located. | This variable is used together with MS_ENABLE_CACHE=TRUE and MS_CACHE_PORT. |Optional|None|
|MS_CACHE_PORT|MindData|Specifies the port number of the host where the cache server is located when the cache function is enabled. |String|Port number of the host where the cache server is located. | This variable is used together with MS_ENABLE_CACHE=TRUE and MS_CACHE_HOST. |Optional|None|
|DATASET_ENABLE_NUMA|MindData|Determines whether to enable numa bind feature. Most of time this configuration can improve performance on distribute scenario. |String| True: Enables the numa bind feature. |This variable is used together with libnuma.so. |Optional|None|
|OPTIMIZE|MindData|Determines whether to optimize the pipeline tree for dataset during data processing. This variable can improve the data processing efficiency in the data processing operator fusion scenario. |String|true: enables pipeline tree optimization. <br>false: disables pipeline tree optimization. |None |Optional|None|
|ENABLE_MS_DEBUGGER|Debugger|Determines whether to enable Debugger during training. |Boolean|1: enables Debugger. <br>0: disables Debugger. |This variable is used together with MS_DEBUGGER_HOST and MS_DEBUGGER_PORT. |Optional|None|
|MS_DEBUGGER_HOST|Debugger|Specifies the IP of the MindInsight Debugger Server. |String|IP address of the host where the MindInsight Debugger Server is located. |This variable is used together with ENABLE_MS_DEBUGGER=1 and MS_DEBUGGER_PORT.|Optional|None|
|MS_DEBUGGER_PORT|Debugger|Specifies the port for connecting to the MindInsight Debugger Server. |Integer|Port number ranges from 1 to 65536. |This variable is used together with ENABLE_MS_DEBUGGER=1 and MS_DEBUGGER_HOST.|Optional|None|
|MS_DEBUGGER_PARTIAL_MEM|Debugger|Determines whether to enable partial memory overcommitment. (Memory overcommitment is disabled only for nodes selected on Debugger.)|Boolean|1: enables memory overcommitment for nodes selected on Debugger. <br>0: disables memory overcommitment for nodes selected on Debugger. |None|Optional|None|
|GE_USE_STATIC_MEMORY|GraphEngine| When a network model has too many layers, the intermediate computing data of a feature map may exceed 25 GB, for example, on the BERT24 network. In the multi-device scenario, to ensure efficient memory collaboration, set this variable to 1, indicating that static memory allocation mode is used. For other networks, dynamic memory allocation mode is used by default. <br>In static memory allocation mode, the default allocation is 31 GB, which is determined by the sum of graph_memory_max_size and variable_memory_max_size. In dynamic memory allocation mode, the allocation is within the sum of graph_memory_max_size and variable_memory_max_size. |Integer|1: static memory allocation mode<br>0: dynamic memory allocation mode|None|Optional|None|
|DUMP_GE_GRAPH|GraphEngine|Outputs the graph description information of each phase in the entire process to a file. This environment variable controls contents of the dumped graph. |Integer|1: full dump<br>2: basic dump without data such as weight<br>3: simplified dump with only node relationships displayed|None|Optional|None|
|DUMP_GRAPH_LEVEL|GraphEngine|Outputs the graph description information of each phase in the entire process to a file. This environment variable controls the number of dumped graphs. |Integer|1: dumps all graphs. <br>2: dumps all graphs except subgraphs. <br>3: dumps the last generated graph. |None |Optional |None|
