<font size=3>**Q: What can I do if the network performance is abnormal and weight initialization takes a long time during training after MindSpore is installed?**</font>

A: The `scipy 1.4` series versions may be used in the environment. Run the `pip list | grep scipy` command to view the scipy version and change the `scipy` version to that required by MindSpore. You can view the third-party library dependency in the `requirement.txt` file.
