## Overview

In recent years, the scale of neural networks has increased exponentially. Limited by the memory on a single device, the number of devices used for training large models is also increasing. Due to the low communication bandwidth between servers, the performance of the conventional hybrid parallelism `data parallel + model parallel` is poor. Therefore, pipeline parallelism needs to be introduced. Pipeline parallel can divide a model in space based on stage. Each stage needs to execute only a part of the network, which greatly reduces memory overheads, shrinks the communication domain, and shortens the communication time. MindSpore can automatically convert a standalone model to the pipeline parallel mode based on user configurations.

> Hardware platforms supported by the pipeline parallel model include Ascend, GPU, and need to be run in Graph mode.

Related interfaces:

1. `mindspore.parallel.auto_parallel.AutoParallel(network, parallel_mode="semi_auto")`: Encapsulates the specified parallel mode via static graph parallelism, where `network` is the top-level `Cell` or function to be encapsulated, and `parallel_mode` takes the value `semi_auto`, indicating a semi-automatic parallel mode. The interface returns a `Cell` encapsulated with parallel configuration.

2. `mindspore.parallel.auto_parallel.AutoParallel.pipeline(stages=1, output_broadcast=False, interleave=False, scheduler='1f1b')`: Configures pipeline parallelism settings. `stages` specifies the total number of partitions for pipeline parallelism. `output_broadcast` determines whether to broadcast the output of the final pipeline stage to all other stages during inference. `interleave` shows that whether to enable interleaving scheduling.`scheduler` defines the pipeline scheduling strategy. Supported values: `gpipe` and `1f1b`.

3. `mindspore.parallel.Pipeline(network, micro_size=1, stage_config={"cell1":0, "cell2":1})`: Pipeline parallelism requires wrapping the network with an additional layer of `Pipeline`, `micro_size` specifies the number of MicroBatch, which are finer-grained splits of a MiniBatch to improve hardware utilization. The final loss is the accumulation of losses from all MicroBatches. `stage_config` indicates the stage assignment for each Cell in the network. `micro_size` must be greater than or equal to the number of `stages`.

4. `mindspore.parallel.PipelineGradReducer(parameters, scale_sense=1.0, opt_shard=None)`: pipeline parallelism requires using `PipelineGradReducer` for gradient reduction. Because the output of pipeline parallelism is derived by the addition of several micro-batch outputs, as the gradient do.

5. `mindspore.parallel.sync_pipeline_shared_parameters(net)`: Synchronize pipeline parallel stage shared parameters.

## Basic Principle

Pipeline parallel is the splitting of operators in a neural network into multiple stages, and then mapping the stages to different devices, so that different devices can compute different parts of the neural network. Pipeline parallel is suitable for graph structures where the model is linear.

As shown in Figure 1, the network of 4 layers of MatMul is split into 4 stages and distributed to 4 devices. In forward calculations, each machine sends the result to the next machine through the communication operator after calculating the MatMul on the machine, and at the same time, the next machine receives (Receive) the MatMul result of the previous machine through the communication operator, and starts to calculate the MatMul on the machine; In reverse calculation, after the gradient of the last machine is calculated, the result is sent to the previous machine, and at the same time, the previous machine receives the gradient result of the last machine and begins to calculate the reverse of the current machine.

### GPipe Pipeline Parallel Scheduler

Simply splitting the model onto multiple devices does not bring about a performance gain, because the linear structure of the model has only one device at work at a time, while other devices are waiting, resulting in a waste of resources. In order to improve efficiency, the pipeline parallel further divides the small batch (MiniBatch) into more fine-grained micro batches (MicroBatch), and adopts a pipeline execution sequence in the micro batch, so as to achieve the purpose of improving efficiency.

As shown in Figure 2. The small batches are cut into 4 micro-batches, and the 4 micro-batches are executed on 4 groups to form a pipeline. The gradient aggregation of the micro-batch is used to update the parameters, where each device only stores and updates the parameters of the corresponding group. where the white ordinal number represents the index of the micro-batch.

### 1F1B Pipeline Parallel Scheduler

In MindSpore's pipeline parallel implementation, the execution order has been adjusted for better memory management.

As shown in Figure 3, the reverse of the MicroBatch numbered 0 is performed immediately after its forward execution, so that the memory of the intermediate result of the numbered 0 MicroBatch is freed earlier (compared to Figure 2), thus ensuring that the peak memory usage is lower than in the way of Figure 2.

### Interleaved Pipeline Scheduler

In order to improve the efficiency of pipeline parallelism and reduce the proportion of bubbles, Megatron LM proposes a new pipeline parallel scheduling strategy called "interleaved pipeline". Traditional pipeline parallelism typically places several consecutive model layers (such as Transformer layers) on a stage, as shown in Figure 3. In the scheduling of interleaved pipeline, each stage performs interleaved calculations on non-continuous model layers to further reduce the proportion of bubbles with more communication, as shown in Figure 4. For example, in traditional pipeline parallelism, each stage has 2 model layers, namely: stage 0 has layers 0 and 1, stage 1 has layers 2 and 3, stage 2 has layers 4 and 5, and stage 3 has layers 6 and 7, while in interleaved pipeline, stage 0 has layers 0 and 4, stage 1 has layers 1 and 5, stage 2 has layers 2 and 6, and stage 3 has layers 3 and 7.

### MindSpore Interleaved Pipeline Scheduler

MindSpore has made memory optimization based on Megatron LM interleaved pipeline scheduling by moving some forward execution sequences back, as shown in Figure 5, which can accumulate less MicroBatch memory during memory peak hours.
