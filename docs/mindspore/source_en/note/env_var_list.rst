   * - Environment Variable
     - Function
     - Type
     - Value Range
     - Description
   * - GLOG_log_dir
     - Specifies the log level.
     - String
     - File path, which can be a relative path or an absolute path.
     - This variable is used together with GLOG_logtostderr

       If the value of `GLOG_logtostderr` is 0, this variable must be set
	   
       If `GLOG_log_dir` is specified and the value of `GLOG_logtostderr` is 1, the logs are output to the screen and not to the file
	 
       The log saving path is: `specified path/rank_${rank_id}/logs/`. Under non-distributed training scenario, `rank_id` is 0, while under distributed training scenario, `rank_id` is the ID of the current device in the cluster 

       C++ and Python logs are output to different files. The C++ logs follow the `GLOG` log file naming rules. In this case `mindspore.machine name. user name.log.log level.timestamp.Process ID`, the Python log file name is `mindspore.log.process ID`.
	   
       `GLOG_log_dir` can only contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, "-", "_", "/" characters, etc.
   * - GLOG_max_log_size
     - Control the size of the MindSpore C++ module log file. You can change the default maximum value of the log file with this environment variable
     - Integer
     - Positive integer. Default value: 50MB
     - If the current written log file exceeds the maximum value, the new output log content is written to a new log file
   * - GLOG_logtostderr
     - Specifies the log output mode.
     - Integer
     - 1: logs are output to the screen
       
       0: logs are output to a file

       Default: 1
     - This variable is used together with GLOG_log_dir
   * - GLOG_stderrthreshold
     - The log module will print logs to the screen when these logs are output to a file. This environment variable is used to control the log level printed to the screen in this scenario.
     - Integer
     - 0-DEBUG
       
       1-INFO

       2-WARNING

       3-ERROR

       4-CRITICAL

       Default: 2
     - 
   * - GLOG_v
     - Specifies the log level.
     - Integer
     - 0-DEBUG
       
       1-INFO

       2-WARNING

       3-ERROR, indicating that the program execution error, output error log, and the program may not terminate
	   
       4-CRITICAL, indicating that the execution of the program is abnormal, and the program may not terminate

       Default: 2.
     - After a log level is specified, output log messages greater than or equal to that level
   * - logger_backupCount
     - Controls the number of mindspore Python module log files.
     - Integer
     - Default: 30
     - 
   * - logger_maxBytes
     - Controls the size of the mindspore Python module log file.
     - Integer
     - Default: 52428800 bytes
     - 
   * - MS_SUBMODULE_LOG_v
     - Specifies log levels of C++ sub modules of MindSpore.
     - Dict {String:Integer...}
     - 0-DEBUG
       
       1-INFO

       2-WARNING

       3-ERROR

     - The assignment way is:`MS_SUBMODULE_LOG_v="{SubModule1:LogLevel1,SubModule2:LogLevel2,...}"`

       The log level of the specified sub-module will override the setting of `GLOG_v` in this module, where the log level of the sub-module `LogLevel` has the same meaning as that of `GLOG_v`. For a detailed list of MindSpore sub-modules, see `sub-module_names <https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/master/mindspore/core/utils/log_adapter.cc>`_.
	   
       For example, you can set the log level of `PARSER` and `ANALYZER` modules to WARNING and the log level of other modules to INFO by `GLOG_v=1 MS_SUBMODULE_LOG_v="{PARSER:2,ANALYZER:2}"`.
   * - GLOG_logfile_mode
     - The GLOG environment variable used to control the permissions of the GLOG log files in MindSpore
     - octal number
     - Refer to the numerical representation of the Linux file permission setting, default value: 0640 (value taken)
     -
   * - MS_RDR_ENABLE
     - Determines whether to enable running data recorder (RDR). 
       If a running exception occurs in MindSpore, the pre-recorded data in MindSpore is automatically exported to assist in locating the cause of the running exception.
     - Integer
     - 1：enables RDR
       
       0：disables RDR
     - This variable is used together with `MS_RDR_MODE` and `MS_RDR_PATH`.
   * - MS_RDR_MODE
     - Determines the exporting mode of running data recorder (RDR).
     - Integer
     - 1：export data when training process terminates in exceptional scenario

       2：export data when training process terminates in both exceptional scenario and normal scenario.
       
       Default: 1.
     - This variable is used together with `MS_RDR_ENABLE=1`.
   * - MS_RDR_PATH
     - Specifies the system path for storing the data recorded by running data recorder (RDR).
     - String
     - Directory path, which should be an absolute path.
     - This variable is used together with `MS_RDR_ENABLE=1`. The final directory for recording data is `${MS_RDR_PATH}` `/rank_${RANK_ID}/rdr/`. 
       `RANK_ID` is the unique ID for multi-cards training, the single card scenario defaults to `RANK_ID=0`.
   * - MS_EXCEPTION_DISPLAY_LEVEL
     - Control the display level of exception information
     - Integer
     - 0: display exception information related to model developers and framework developers

       1: display exception information related to model developers

       Default: 0
     - 

Note: glog does not support log file wrapping. If you need to control the log file occupation of disk space, you can use the log file management tool provided by the operating system, for example: logrotate for Linux. Please set the log environment variables before `import mindspore` .

For more detailed information about RDR, refer to `Running Data Recorder <https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorials/experts/en/master/debug/rdr.html#running-data-recorder>`_ .
