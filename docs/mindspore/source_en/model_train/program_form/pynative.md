## Basic Capability

In MindSpore, dynamic graph mode is also known as PyNative mode, which is default mode, and can also be set to dynamic graph mode by `set_context(mode=PYNATIVE_MODE)`. In script development and network flow debugging, debugging is convenient in dynamic graph mode, and the dynamic graph mode supports the execution of single operators, common functions and networks, and separate gradient solving operations.

In PyNative mode, users can use the full Python API. In addition, for using the API provided by MindSpore, the framework will execute the operations of the operator API on the corresponding hardware platform according to the hardware platform (Ascend, GPU, CPU) selected by the user and return the corresponding results. The overall execution process of the framework is as follows:

Through the front-end Python API, call to the framework layer, and finally to the corresponding hardware devices to perform calculations. For example, to complete an addition

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore as ms
import mindspore.ops as ops

ms.set_context(mode=ms.PYNATIVE_MODE, device_target="CPU")
x = ms.Tensor(np.ones([1, 3, 3, 4]).astype(np.float32))
y = ms.Tensor(np.ones([1, 3, 3, 4]).astype(np.float32))
output = ops.add(x, y)
print(output.asnumpy())
```

```text
[[[[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]

  [[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]

  [[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]]]
```

In this example, when the Python interface ops.add(x, y) is called, the Python interface call is called to the C++ layer of the framework via Pybind11, and converted to C++ call. Then the framework will select the corresponding hardware device according to the device_target set by the users, and execute the add operation on that hardware device.

From the above principle, we can see that in PyNative mode, Python script code will be executed according to Python syntax, and the execution process involves MindSpore's API, which will be accelerated by executing on different hardware according to user settings. Therefore, in PyNative mode, users can use Python syntax and debugging methods at will, for example, you can use common IDEs such as PyCharm and VS Code to debug code.
