## Overview

The backends supported by MindSpore include Ascend, GPU, and CPU. The device in the "On-Device" refers to the Ascend AI processor.

The Ascend AI processor integrates the AI core, AI CPU, and CPU. The AI core is responsible for large Tensor Vector computing, the AI CPU is responsible for scalar computing, and the CPU is responsible for logic control and task distribution.

The CPU on the host side delivers graphs or operators to the Ascend AI processor. The Ascend AI processor has the functions of computing, logic control, and task distribution. Therefore, it does not need to frequently interact with the CPU on the host side. It only needs to return the final calculation result to the host. In this way, the entire graph is sunk to the device for execution, avoiding frequent interaction between the host and device and reducing overheads.

### Computational Graphs on Devices

The entire graph is executed on the device to reduce the interaction overheads between the host and device. Multiple steps can be moved downwards together with cyclic sinking to further reduce the number of interactions between the host and device.

Cyclic sinking is optimized based on on-device execution to further reduce the number of interactions between the host and device. Generally, each step returns a result. Cyclic sinking is used to control the number of steps at which a result is returned.

By default, the result is returned for each epoch. In this way, the host and device need to exchange data only once in each epoch.

You can also use `dataset_sink_mode` and `sink_size` of the `train` interface to control the sunk data volume of each epoch.

### Data Sinking

The `train` interface parameter `dataset_sink_mode` of `Model` can be used to control whether data sinks. If the value of `dataset_sink_mode` is True, data sinking is enabled. Otherwise, data sinking is disabled. Sinking means that data is directly transmitted to the device through a channel.

The `dataset_sink_mode` parameter can be used with `sink_size` to control the amount of data sunk by each `epoch`. When `dataset_sink_mode` is set to True, that is, the data sinking mode is used:

If `sink_size` is set to the default value â€“1, the amount of data sunk by each `epoch` is the size of the original entire dataset.

If `sink_size` is greater than 0, the raw dataset can be traversed for an unlimited number of times. Each `epoch` sinks the data volume of `sink_size`, and the next `epoch` continues to traverse from the end position of the previous traversal.

The total sunk data volume is controlled by the `epoch` and `sink_size` variables. That is, the total data volume is calculated as follows: Total data volume = `epoch` x `sink_size`.

When using `LossMonitor`, `TimeMonitor` or other `Callback` interfaces, if the `dataset_sink_mode` is set to False, each `step` between the Host side and the Device side interacts once, so each `step` will return a result. If `dataset_sink_mode` is True, because the data is transmitted through the channel on the Device, there is one data interaction between the Host side and the Device side for each `epoch`, so each `epoch` only returns one result.

> The CPU and pynative mode cannot support dataset sink mode currently.

```text

epoch: 9 step: 1000, loss is 0.010310417
epoch: 10 step: 1000, loss is 0.000672762
```

When `batch_size` is 32, the size of the dataset is 1875. When `sink_size` is set to 1000, each `epoch` sinks 1000 batches of data, the number of sinks is `epoch` (=10), and the total sunk data volume is `epoch` x `sink_size` = 10000.

`dataset_sink_mode` is True, so every `epoch` returns a result.

> When `dataset_sink_mode` is set to False, the `sink_size` parameter is invalid.
