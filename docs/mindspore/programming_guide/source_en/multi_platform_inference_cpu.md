## Inference Using an ONNX File

Similar to the inference on a GPU, the following steps are required:

1. Generate a model in ONNX format on the training platform. For details, see [Export ONNX Model](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/programming_guide/en/r1.6/save_model.html#export-onnx-model).

2. Perform inference on a CPU by referring to the runtime or SDK document. For details about how to use the ONNX Runtime, see the [ONNX Runtime document](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime).
