Data is the foundation of deep learning, and high-quality data input will play a positive role in the entire deep neural network.
In the network training and inference process, the original data is generally stored in a disk or a database, and it needs to be first read into the memory space through the data loading step, converted into the framework's common tensor (Tensor) format, and then processed and enhanced by the data step, map it to a feature space that is easier to learn, while increasing the number of samples and generalization, and finally input to the network for calculation.

The overall process is shown in the figure below:

This chapter introduces some basic concepts involved in data loading, data processing, and enhancement operations in `mindspore.dataset`(hereinafter referred to as Dataset).

## Dataset

![avatar](images/basic_dataset_data.png)

A dataset is a collection of samples. A row of the dataset is a sample that contains one or more features, and may also contain a label. The dataset needs to meet certain specifications to facilitate the evaluation of the model's effect.

Dataset supports multiple format data sets, including MindSpore self-developed data format MindRecord, commonly used public image data sets and text data sets, user-defined data sets, etc. For detailed data sets supported by Mindspore, please refer to: [MindSpore Support Data Sets](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/programming_guide/en/r1.5/dataset_loading.html).

Dataset also supports the conversion of commonly used data sets and user-defined data sets to MindSpore data format (MindRecord). For details, please refer to: [Converting Data Sets to MindRecord](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/programming_guide/en/r1.5/convert_dataset.html).

## Dataset Loading

![avatar](images/basic_dataset_load.png)

The dataset loading makes the model training continuously obtain data for training.

Dataset provides corresponding classes for a variety of commonly used data sets to load data sets. At the same time, for data files in different storage formats, Dataset also has corresponding classes for data loading. For loading of MindSpore dataset, please refer to: [loading of MindSpore dataset](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/programming_guide/en/r1.5/dataset_loading.html).

Dataset provides a sampler for multiple purposes (Sampler), the sampler is responsible for generating the read index sequence, the Dataset is responsible for reading the corresponding data according to the index, and helping users to sample the dataset in different forms to meet training needs and solve problems such as the dataset is too large or the sample category distribution is uneven. Note that the sampler is responsible for filtering and reordering the samples, and will not perform the batch operation.

For the introduction of Mindspore data sampling, please refer to: [MindSpore data sampling](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/programming_guide/en/r1.5/sampler.html).

## Data Processing

After the Dataset loads the data into the memory, the data is organized in the form of Tensor. At the same time, Tensor is also the basic data structure in data augmentation operations.

### Shuffle Operation

![avatar](images/basic_dataset_shuffle.png)

Training is generally multiple epochs, and the shuffle operation disrupts the order of the data to ensure that the data order of each epoch is different during training to prevent training from overfitting.

Dataset provides multiple ways to implement global shuffle operations.

1. `shuffle` parameters of the dataset loading class

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import mindspore.dataset as ds
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    dataset = ds.NumpySlicesDataset(data=data, column_names=["column_1"], shuffle=True)
    ```

    For details, please refer to: [NumpySlicesDataset](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/api/en/r1.5/api_python/dataset/mindspore.dataset.NumpySlicesDataset.html).

2. shuffle operator

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import mindspore.dataset as ds
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    dataset = ds.NumpySlicesDataset(data=data, column_names=["column_1"])
    # buffer_size equal to the number of rows in the entire dataset will result in a global     shuffle
    dataset = dataset.shuffle(4)
    ```

    For details, please refer to: [shuffle API](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/api/en/r1.5/api_python/dataset/mindspore.dataset.GeneratorDataset.html#mindspore.dataset.GeneratorDataset.shuffle).

3. Random sampling

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import mindspore.dataset as ds
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    sampler = ds.RandomSampler()
    dataset = ds.NumpySlicesDataset(data=data, column_names=["column_1"],sampler=sampler)
    ```

    For details, please refer to: [RandomSampler](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/api/en/r1.5/api_python/dataset/mindspore.dataset.RandomSampler.html#mindspore-dataset-randomsampler).

### Map Operation

![avatar](images/basic_dataset_map.png)

The Map operation performs data enhancement on all kinds of data, is responsible for starting and executing the data enhancement operators provided by the Dataset or user-defined, and mapping and transforming the data. Among them, data enhancement is a method of creating "new" data with different directions. One is to generate "more data" from limited data, and the other is to prevent overfitting.

Dataset's `c_transforms` and `py_transforms` modules provide implementations of data enhancement operators based on `C++` and `Python` respectively, and users can customize functions for data enhancement.

For image data enhancement operations, please refer to: [image data enhancement](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/programming_guide/en/r1.5/augmentation.html).

For text data enhancement operations, please refer to: [[text data enhancement](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/programming_guide/en/r1.5/tokenizer.html).

For Map operation, please refer to: [Map operation](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/api/en/r1.5/api_python/dataset/mindspore.dataset.CelebADataset.html#mindspore.dataset.CelebADataset.map).

### Batch Operation

![avatar](images/basic_dataset_batch.png)

Only one sample is used to train the model at a time, which has good randomness, but poor parallelization, resulting in low training efficiency. The introduction of mini-batch can better balance the training speed and training effect.

The Batch operation is responsible for "packing" multiple `Tensors` with the same `shape` together to achieve training in a mini-batch manner. The Batch operation also provides the drop_remainder parameter, which means that the last batch that does not have a batch_size is deleted, and it will be retained by default. If the dataset size is 17373, 8 cards are used for training and the Batch size is 16, each card is allocated 2172 samples. When drop_remainder is True, 135 mini-batch can be packed on each card.

Before the "packing" action, Batch supports `Tensors` with inconsistent `shapes` according to user requirements, or automatically fills the `shapes` of `Tensors` in the same way, and executes user-defined functions through `Per_batch_map` before "packing".

1. padding operation

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import mindspore.dataset as ds
    # col1d: [0],[1]
    # col2d: [[100],[200]], [[101],[201]]
    def gen_2cols(num):
    for i in range(num):
        yield (np.array([i]), np.array([[i + 100], [i + 200]]))
    dataset = ds.GeneratorDataset((lambda: gen_2cols(2)), ["col1d", "col2d"])
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size=2, drop_remainder=False, pad_info={"col2d": ([2, 2], -2) , "col1d": ([2], -1)})
    # col1d: [0, -1], [1, -1]
    # col2d: [[100, -2], [200, -2]], [[101, -2], [201, -2]]
    ```

2. per_batch_map operation

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import mindspore.dataset as ds
    # first column: 0, 3, 6, 9 ...
    # second column:1, 4, 7, 10 ...
    # third column: 2, 5, 8, 11 ...
    def gen_3_cols(num):
    for i in range(num):
        yield (np.array([i * 3]), np.array([i * 3 + 1]), np.array([i * 3 + 2]))
    # first epoch batch_size per batch: 1, 2 ,3 ...
    # second epoch batch_size per batch: 2, 4, 6 ...
    # third epoch batch_size per batch: 3, 6 ,9 ...
    def batch_func(batchInfo):
    return (batchInfo.get_batch_num() + 1) * (batchInfo.get_epoch_num() + 1)

    # multiply first col by batch_num, multiply second col by -batch_num
    def map_func(col1, col2, batchInfo):
    return ([np.copy((1 + batchInfo.get_batch_num()) * arr) for arr in col1],
        [np.copy(-(1 + batchInfo.get_batch_num()) * arr) for arr in col2])
    # col1: [[0]], [[ 6], [12]], [[27]]
    # col2: [[-1]],[[ -8], [-14]],  [[-30]]
    # col3: [[2]], [[5], [8]], [[11]]
    dataset = ds.GeneratorDataset((lambda: gen_3_cols(4)), ["col1", "col2", "col3"]).batch (batch_size=batch_func, input_columns=["col1", "col2"], per_batch_map=map_func)
    ```
