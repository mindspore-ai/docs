<font size=3>**Q: What should I do when error `/usr/bin/ld: warning: libxxx.so, needed by libmindspore.so, not found` prompts during application compiling?**</font>

A: Find the directory where the missing dynamic library file is located, add the path to the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and refer to [Inference Using the MindIR Model on Ascend 310 AI Processors#Building Inference Code](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/programming_guide/en/r1.3/multi_platform_inference_ascend_310_mindir.html#building-inference-code) for environment variable settings.

<font size=3>**Q: What should I do when error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'te'` prompts during application running?**</font>

A: First confirm whether the system environment is installed correctly and whether the whl packages such as `te` and `topi` are installed correctly. If there are multiple Python versions in the user environment, such as Conda virtual environment, you need to execute `ldd name_of_your_executable_app` to confirm whether the application link `libpython3.7m.so.1.0` is consistent with the current Python directory, if not, you need to adjust the order of the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` .
