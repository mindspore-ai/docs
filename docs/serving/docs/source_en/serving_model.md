# Servable Provided Through Model Configuration

[![View Source On Gitee](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/raw/r1.5/resource/_static/logo_source_en.png)](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/r1.5/docs/serving/docs/source_en/serving_model.md)

## Overview

MindSpore Serving supports the Ascend 310, Ascend 910 and Nvidia GPU environments.

MindSpore Serving Servable provides the inference services of the following types: One inference service comes from a single model, and the other one comes from a combination of multiple models (this is being developed). Models need to be configured to provide the Serving inference service.

The following describes how to configure a single model to provide Servable. All Servable configurations are for single-model Servables and the Serving client is referred to as the client.

ResNet-50 is used as an example to describe how to configure a model to provide Servable. For details about the sample code, see the [ResNet-50 Example](https://gitee.com/mindspore/serving/tree/r1.5/example/resnet/).

## Concepts

### Preprocessing and Post-processing

A model provides the inference capability. Its input and output have fixed data type, data length, and shape.

If data sent from the client cannot directly meet model input requirements, the data needs to be preprocessed and converted into the qualified data.
If the model output cannot be not directly provided for the client, post-processing is required to convert the output into the required output data.

The following shows the `resnet50` Servable data flowchart. The image data is transmitted from the client to the Serving through a network. The Serving performs preprocessing, inference, and post-processing, and returns the result to the client.

![image](images/resnet_example.png)

For a ResNet-50 inference model, the data sent by the client is images in JPG or PNG format, and the image classification is expected to be returned. The input of a ResNet model is the tensor generated by operations such as image `Decode`, `Resize`, and `Normalize`. The output is the score tensor of each category. The image needs to be converted into a tensor that meets the model input requirements during preprocessing. **Name of the top 1 category** or **Names of the top 5 categories and their scores** are returned after post-processing.

The provided preprocessing may vary according to the composition, structure, or type of data input from the client in different scenarios. The provided post-processing may also vary according to the model output requirements. For example, in the preceding `resnet50` Servable, two post-processing methods are provided for the following two scenarios: **Name of the top 1 category** and **Names of the top 5 categories and their scores**.

### Methods

The preceding `resnet` Servable provides the `classify_top5` and `classify_top1` methods. The input of `classify_top5` is `image`, and the output is `label` and `score`. The top 5 category names and scores are returned. The preprocessing of `classify_top1` is the same as that of `classify_top5`, but the post-processing is different. The input is `image`, and the output is `label`. The top 1 category name is returned.

One Servable can provide one or more methods. The Servable name and the method name are marked with a service provided by the Serving. Each method preprocesses the data provided by the client, performs model inference and optional post-processing on the model inference result, and returns the required result to the client.

A Servable is used to:

- Specify optional preprocessing and post-processing.
- Define a data flow between method input, preprocessing, model, post-processing, and method output. The former data value can be used as the latter data input. For example, the value of method output may come from the method input, preprocessing, model, or post-processing.
- Specify a method name for the client to specify a method to be used.
- Specify the input and output names of a method for the client to specify the input and obtain the output.

### Instances

Each request includes one or more independent instances which do not affect each other's result. For example, a category is returned for an image, and three categories are returned for three independent images.

## Model Configuration

Take the ResNet-50 model as an example. The model configuration file directory is as follows:

```text
resnet50
├── 1
│   └── resnet50_1b_cifar10.mindir
├── 2
│   └── resnet50_1b_cifar10.mindir
└── servable_config.py
```

- `resnet50`: a directory, which is named after the Servable name.

- `servable_config.py`: configures Servable, including preprocessing and post-processing definitions, model declaration, and method definition.

- `1` and `2`: directories, which indicate models of the `1` and `2` versions. The model version is a positive integer starting from `1`. A larger number indicates a later version.

- `resnet50_1b_cifar10.mindir`: a model file. When the Servable is started, the model file of the corresponding version is loaded.

### Preprocessing and Post-processing Definition

The following is an example to define preprocessing and post-processing:

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore.dataset.vision.c_transforms as VC

# cifar 10
idx_2_label = ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']


def preprocess_eager(image):
    """
    Define preprocess, input is image numpy, return preprocess result.
    Return type can be numpy, str, bytes, int, float, or bool.
    Use MindData Eager, this image processing can also use other image processing library,
    likes numpy, PIL or cv2 etc.
    """
    image_size = 224
    mean = [0.4914 * 255, 0.4822 * 255, 0.4465 * 255]
    std = [0.2023 * 255, 0.1994 * 255, 0.2010 * 255]

    decode = VC.Decode()
    resize = VC.Resize([image_size, image_size])
    normalize = VC.Normalize(mean=mean, std=std)
    hwc2chw = VC.HWC2CHW()

    image = decode(image)
    image = resize(image)
    image = normalize(image)
    image = hwc2chw(image)
    return image

def postprocess_top1(score):
    """
    Define postprocess. This example has one input and one output.
    The input is the numpy tensor of the score, and the output is the label str of top one.
    """
    max_idx = np.argmax(score)
    return idx_2_label[max_idx]


def postprocess_top5(score):
    """
    Define postprocess. This example has one input and two outputs.
    The input is the numpy tensor of the score. The first output is the str joined by labels of top five, and the second output is the score tensor of the top five.
    """
    idx = np.argsort(score)[::-1][:5]  # top 5
    ret_label = [idx_2_label[i] for i in idx]
    ret_score = score[idx]
    return ";".join(ret_label), ret_score
```

The preprocessing and post-processing are defined in the same format. The input parameters are the input data of each instance. If the input data is a text, the input parameter is a str object. If the input data is of other types, such as Tensor, Scalar number, Boolean, and Bytes, the input parameter is a **numpy object**. The instance processing result is returned through `return`, and each returned data can be **numpy array, bool, int, float, str, or bytes**.

The input sources and output usage of preprocessing and post-processing are determined by the [Method Definition](#method-definition).

### Model Declaration

The sample code for declaring the `resnet50` Servable model is as follows:

```python
from mindspore_serving.server import register
resnet_model = register.declare_model(model_file="resnet50_1b_cifar10.mindir", model_format="MindIR", with_batch_dim=True)
```

The input parameter `model_file` of `declare_model` indicates the model file name. `model_format` indicates the model type. Currently, the Ascend 310 environment supports both `OM` and `MindIR` model types. The Ascend 910 and GPU environment supports only the `MindIR` model type.

If the 1D model input and output is not the `batch` dimension, you need to change the value of `with_batch_dim` from the default value `True` to `False`.

Set `with_batch_dim` to `True` if models contain the `batch` dimension, such as image and text processing models. Assume that `batch_size=2` and the current request has three instances of images which will be split into two batches for model inference. For the first batch, two images are inferred to return two results. For the second batch, the remaining image is copied and inferred to return one result. Finally, three results are returned.

![image](images/resnet_with_batch.png)

Set `with_batch_dim` to `False` if models do not involve or consider the `batch` dimension. For example, the input and output are matrix multiplication models of 2D tensors. Each instance of the request performs an independent inference task.

![image](./images/matmul_without_batch.png)

If a model has one data input with `batch` dimension information and one model configuration information input without `batch` dimension information, you need to set `with_batch_dim` to `True` and set an extra parameter `without_batch_dim_inputs` to specify the input information that does not contain the `batch` dimension information.
For example:

```python
from mindspore_serving.server import register
# Input1 indicates the input shape information of the model, without the batch dimension information.
# input0: [N,3,416,416], input1: [2]
yolov_model = register.declare_model(model_file="yolov3_darknet53.mindir", model_format="MindIR",
                                     with_batch_dim=True, without_batch_dim_inputs=1)
```

For distributed model, the only difference compared with non-distributed single model configuration is declaration, you need to use `mindspore_serving.server.distributed.declare_servable` method, `rank_size` is the number of devices used in the model, `stage_size` is the number of stages in the pipeline.

```python
from mindspore_serving.server import distributed

model = distributed.declare_servable(rank_size=8, stage_size=1, with_batch_dim=False)
```

### Method Definition

An example of the method definition is as follows:

```python
from mindspore_serving.server import register

@register.register_method(output_names=["label"])
def classify_top1(image):
    """Define method `classify_top1` for servable `resnet50`.
     The input is `image` and the output is `label`."""
    x = register.add_stage(preprocess_eager, image, outputs_count=1)
    x = register.add_stage(resnet_model, x, outputs_count=1)
    x = register.add_stage(postprocess_top1, x, outputs_count=1)
    return x


@register.register_method(output_names=["label", "score"])
def classify_top5(image):
    """Define method `classify_top5` for servable `resnet50`.
     The input is `image` and the output is `label` and `score`. """
    x = register.add_stage(preprocess_eager, image, outputs_count=1)
    x = register.add_stage(resnet_model, x, outputs_count=1)
    label, score = register.add_stage(postprocess_top5, x, outputs_count=2)
    return label, score
```

The preceding code defines the `classify_top1` and `classify_top5` methods in Servable `resnet50`. The input parameter of the `classify_top1` method is `image` and the output parameter is `label`. The input parameter of the `classify_top5` method is `image` and the output parameters are `label` and `score`. That is, the input parameters of the Servable method are specified by the input parameters of the Python method, and the output parameters of the Servable method are specified by `output_names` of `register_method`.

In the preceding method definition:

- `add_stage` specifies the preprocessing, model and post-processing used and their inputs.

- `return` specifies the data returned by the method and corresponds to the `output_names` parameter of `register_method`.

When a user uses a service provided by a Servable method on the client, the user needs to specify the input value based on the input parameter name and identify the output value based on the output parameter name. For example, the method `classify_top5` accessed by the client is as follows:

```python
import os
from mindspore_serving.client import Client

def read_images():
    """Read images for directory test_image"""
    image_files = []
    images_buffer = []
    for path, _, file_list in os.walk("./test_image/"):
        for file_name in file_list:
            image_file = os.path.join(path, file_name)
            image_files.append(image_file)
    for image_file in image_files:
        with open(image_file, "rb") as fp:
            images_buffer.append(fp.read())
    return image_files, images_buffer

def run_classify_top5():
    """Client for servable resnet50 and method classify_top5"""
    client = Client("localhost:5500", "resnet50", "classify_top5")
    instances = []
    image_files, images_buffer = read_images()
    for image in images_buffer:
        instances.append({"image": image})  # input `image`

    result = client.infer(instances)

    for file, result_item in zip(image_files, result):  # result for every image
        label = result_item["label"]  # result `label`
        score = result_item["score"]  # result `score`
        print("file:", file)
        print("label result:", label)
        print("score result:", score)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_classify_top5()
```

In addition, one request may include multiple instances, and multiple requests in queue for processing also have multiple instances. If multiple instances need to be processed concurrently by using, for example, multiple threads in customized preprocessing or post-processing (for example, the MindData concurrency is used to process multiple input images during preprocessing), MindSpore Serving provides parameter `batch_size` for interface `add_stage`. For details, see [ResNet-50 sample model configuration](https://gitee.com/mindspore/serving/blob/r1.5/example/resnet/resnet50/servable_config.py).
