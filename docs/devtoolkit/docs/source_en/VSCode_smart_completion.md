## Functions Description

* Provide AI code completion based on the MindSpore project.
* Easily develop MindSpore without installing MindSpore environment.

## Usage Steps

1. When you install or use the plug-in for the first time, the model will be downloaded automatically. "Start Downloading Model" will appear in the lower right corner, and "Download Model Successfully" indicates that the model is downloaded and started successfully. If the Internet speed is slow, it will take more than ten minutes to download the model. The message "Downloaded Model Successfully" will appear only after the download is complete. If this is not the first time you use it, the message will not appear.
