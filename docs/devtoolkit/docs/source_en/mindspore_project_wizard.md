## Background

This function is implemented based on the [conda](https://conda.io). Conda is a package management and environment management system. It is one of the recommended installation modes for MindSpore.

## Functions

* It creates a conda environment or selects an existing conda environment, and installs the MindSpore binary package in the conda environment.
* It deploys the best practice template. In addition to testing whether the environment is successfully installed, it also provides a tutorial for MindSpore beginners.
* When the network condition is good, the environment can be installed within 10 minutes and you can experience MindSpore immediately. It reduces up to 80% environment configuration time for beginners.
