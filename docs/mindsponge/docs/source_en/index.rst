MindSpore SPONGE Documents
===========================

MindSpore SPONGE is a computative biology suite based on MindSpore, supporting common functions such as molecular dynamics and protein folding.

The molecular simulation or modeling process has a high degree
of logic consistency with the AI model training/inferring process,
so the molecular simulation can in principle be unified with the
AI training/inferring mode. MindSpore SPONGE integrates molecular simulation
and AI training/inferring under the same programming structure.
The overall structure view is as follows:

   MindSpore SPONGE Architecture

Different from traditional molecular simulation software,
AI molecular simulation library has completely new features, such as:

1. Instead of manual derivative programming, automatic differential
   technology provides a unified programming paradigm for different
   energy functions or the construction of complex scoring functions;
2. Fully compatible with neural network models, supporting AI inferring
   within molecular simulation, or simulation as an engine for AI training;
3. The end-to-end differentiable modeling method can realize
   the meta-optimization of the physical model;
4. Hierarchical code architecture, using efficient language operator
   at the bottom; Provide users with object-oriented Python API
   to facilitate user customization;
5. Automatic adaptation of multiple back-end. Users only need to write
   a simple Python code to accelerate execution on multiple back-end,
   such as GPU and NPU;
6. High-throughput simulation supported by automatic parallel. Users
   do not need to distinguish between single or multi-machine execution
   of code, can concurrently simulate multiple systems on a single
   hardware unit, without special MPI programming.

Combined with these new features, the unified framework of molecular
simulation and AI can support a wide range of molecular modeling
and application scenarios, such as:

- Molecular simulation based on AI improved force field or enhanced sampling;
- Data-driven & physics-driven molecular docking;
- Protein structure prediction and force field optimization;
- High throughput molecular simulation;
- Molecular design, etc.

Special Interesting Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MindSpore SPONGE SIG (Special Interesting Group) is a team composed of a
group of people who are interested and have a mission to make
achievements in the field of AI × biological computing.

MindSpore SPONGE SIG group provides efficient and easy-to-use AI
computational biology software for researchers, teachers and students,
and provides a platform for people with strong abilities or strong
interests in this field to communicate and cooperate together.

At present, the SIG group has six core teachers. After members joining
the SIG group, our teachers will lead the team to carry out scientific
research and develop the software function development. Of course,
members are also welcome to do research on their own topics using
MindSpore SPONGE.

In the SIG group, we will hold various activities, including summer
school, public lecture, technology communication meeting and other
large-scale activities. Small-scale activities like weekly meetings,
blogs writing will also be held in the group. By joining the activities,
there will be lots of chances to communicate with our experts. During
the summer school program ended on August 15th, we invited 13 teachers
to have a five-day lecture mainly including three themes of MindSpore
basics, molecular dynamics and advanced AI × Science courses. You can
get the replay

In the SIG group, we will also release the public intelligence task and
`open source internship
task <https://gitee.com/mindspore/community/issues/I561LI?from=project-issue>`__,
welcome everyone to claim it.
