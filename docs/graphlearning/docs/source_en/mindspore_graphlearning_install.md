## Installation

### System Environment Information Confirmation

- Ensure that the hardware platform is Ascend or GPU under the Linux system.
- Refer to [MindSpore Installation Guide](https://www.mindspore.cn/install/en) to complete the installation of MindSpore, which requires at least version 2.0.0.
- For other dependencies, please refer to [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/graphlearning/blob/master/requirements.txt).

### Installation Methods

You can install MindSpore Graph Learning either by pip or by source code.

#### Installation by pip

- Ascend/CPU

    ```bash
    pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/2.0.0rc1/GraphLearning/cpu/{system_structure}/mindspore_gl-0.2-cp37-cp37m-linux_{system_structure}.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
    ```

- GPU

    ```bash
    pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/2.0.0rc1/GraphLearning/gpu/x86_64/cuda-{cuda_verison}/mindspore_gl-0.2-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
    ```

> - When the network is connected, dependency items are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. For details about other dependency items, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/graphlearning/blob/master/requirements.txt). In other cases, you need to manually install dependency items.
> - `{system_structure}` denotes the Linux system architecture, and the option is `x86_64` and `arrch64`.
> - `{cuda_verison}` denotes the CUDA version, and the option is `10.1`, `11.1` and `11.6`ã€‚

#### Installation by Source Code
