# Implementing a Cross-Silo Federated Target Detection Application (x86)

<a href="https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/master/docs/federated/docs/source_en/object_detection_application_in_cross_silo.md" target="_blank"><img src="https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/master/resource/_static/logo_source_en.png"></a>

Based on the type of participating clients, federated learning can be classified into cross-silo federated learning and cross-device federated learning. In a cross-silo federated learning scenario, the clients involved in federated learning are different organizations (e.g., healthcare or finance) or geographically distributed data centers, i.e., training models on multiple data silos. In the cross-device federated learning scenario, the participating clients are a large number of mobile or IoT devices. This framework will describe how to implement a target detection application by using network Fast R-CNN on MindSpore Federated cross-silo federated framework.

The full script to launch cross-silo federated target detection application can be found [here](https://gitee.com/mindspore/federated/tree/master/example/cross_silo_faster_rcnn).

## Preparation

This tutorial deploy the cross-silo federated target detection task based on the faster_rcnn network provided in MindSpore model_zoo. Please first follow the official [faster_rcnn tutorial and code](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/official/cv/FasterRCNN) to understand the COCO dataset, faster_rcnn network structure, training process and evaluation process first. Since the COCO dataset is open source, please refer to its [official website](https://cocodataset.org/#home) guidelines to download a dataset by yourself and perform dataset slicing (for example, suppose there are 100 clients, the dataset can be sliced into 100 copies, each representing the data held by one client).

Since the original COCO dataset is in json file format, the target detection script provided by cross-silo federated learning framework only supports input data in MindRecord format. You can convert the json file to MindRecord format file according to the following steps.

- Configure the following parameters in the configuration file[default_config.yaml](https://gitee.com/mindspore/federated/blob/master/example/cross_silo_faster_rcnn/default_config.yaml):

    - `mindrecord_dir`

        Used to set the generated MindRecord format file save path. The folder name must be mindrecord_{num} format, and the number num represents the client label number 0, 1, 2, 3, ......

        ```sh
        mindrecord_dir:"./datasets/coco_split/split_100/mindrecord_0"
        ```

    - `instance_set`

        Used to set original json file path.

        ```sh
        instance_set: "./datasets/coco_split/split_100/train_0.json"
        ```

- Run the script [generate_mindrecord.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/federated/blob/master/example/cross_silo_faster_rcnn/generate_mindrecord.py) to generate MindRecord file according to `train_0.json`, saved in the `mindrecord_dir` path.

## Starting the Cross-Silo Federated Mission

### Installing MindSpore and Mindspore Federated

Including both downloading source code and downloading release version, supporting CPU, GPU, Ascend hardware platforms, just choose to install according to the hardware platforms.  For the installing step, refer to [MindSpore installation](https://www.mindspore.cn/install)， [Mindspore Federated installation](https://www.mindspore.cn/federated/docs/en/master/index.html).

Currently the federated learning framework is only supported for deployment in Linux environments, and cross-silo federated learning framework requires MindSpore version number >= 1.5.0.

### Starting Mission

```

1. Note that you can choose whether to record the loss value for each step by setting the parameter `dataset_sink_mode` in the `test_fl_fasterrcnn.py` file.

    ```python
    model.train(config.client_epoch_num, dataset, callbacks=cb)  # Not setting dataset_sink_mode means that only the loss value of the last step in each epoch is recorded, which is the default mode in the code
    model.train(config.client_epoch_num, dataset, callbacks=cb, dataset_sink_mode=False)   # Set dataset_sink_mode=False to record the loss value of each step
    ```

2. Set the following parameters in configuration file [default_config.yaml](https://gitee.com/mindspore/federated/blob/master/example/cross_silo_faster_rcnn/default_config.yaml):

    - `pre_trained`

        Used to set the pre-trained model path (.ckpt format).

        The pre-trained model experimented in this tutorial is a ResNet-50 checkpoint trained on ImageNet 2012. You can use the [resnet50](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/official/cv/ResNet) script in ModelZoo to train, and then use src/convert_checkpoint.py to convert the trained resnet50 weight file into a loadable weight file.

3. Start redis

    ```sh
    redis-server --port 2345 --save ""
    ```

4. Start Scheduler

    `run_cross_silo_fasterrcnn_sched.py` is the Python script used to start `Scheduler` and supports modifying the configuration by passing argument `argparse`. Execute the following command, which represents the `Scheduler` that starts this federated learning task. `--yaml_config` is used to set the yaml file path, and its management ip:port is `127.0.0.1:18019`.

    ```sh
    python run_cross_silo_fasterrcnn_sched.py --yaml_config="default_yaml_config.yaml" --scheduler_manage_address="127.0.0.1:18019"
    ```

    For the detailed implementation, see [run_cross_silo_fasterrcnn_sched.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/federated/blob/master/example/cross_silo_faster_rcnn/run_cross_silo_fasterrcnn_sched.py).

    The following print represents a successful starting:

    ```sh
    [INFO] FEDERATED(3944,2b280497ed00,python):2022-10-10-17:11:08.154.878 [mindspore_federated/fl_arch/ccsrc/scheduler/scheduler.cc:35] Run] Scheduler started successfully.
    [INFO] FEDERATED(3944,2b28c5ada700,python):2022-10-10-17:11:08.155.056 [mindspore_federated/fl_arch/ccsrc/common/communicator/http_request_handler.cc:90] Run] Start http server!
    ```

5. Start Server

    `run_cross_silo_fasterrcnn_server.py` is a Python script for starting a number of `Server`s, and supports modifying the configuration by passing argument `argparse`. Execute the following command, representing the `Server` that starts this Federated Learning task with a TCP address of `127.0.0.1`. The starting port for the Federated Learning HTTP service is `6668` and the number of `Server`s is `4`.

    ```sh
    python run_cross_silo_fasterrcnn_server.py --yaml_config="default_yaml_config.yaml" --tcp_server_ip="127.0.0.1" --checkpoint_dir="/path/to/fl_ckpt" --local_server_num=4 --http_server_address="127.0.0.1:6668"
    ```

    The above command is equivalent to starting four `Server` processes, each with a federated learning service port of `6668`, `6669`, `6670` and `6671`, as detailed in [run_cross_silo_fasterrcnn_server.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/federated/blob/master/example/cross_silo_faster_rcnn/run_cross_silo_fasterrcnn_server.py), and checkpoint_dir needs to enter the directory path where the checkpoint is located. The server will read the checkpoint initialization weight from this path. The prefix format of the checkpoint needs to be `{fl_name}_ recovery_ iteration_`.

    The following print represents a successful starting:

    ```sh
    [INFO] FEDERATED(3944,2b280497ed00,python):2022-10-10-17:11:08.154.645 [mindspore_federated/fl_arch/ccsrc/common/communicator/http_server.cc:122] Start] Start http server!
    [INFO] FEDERATED(3944,2b280497ed00,python):2022-10-10-17:11:08.154.725 [mindspore_federated/fl_arch/ccsrc/common/communicator/http_request_handler.cc:85] Initialize] Ev http register handle of: [/d    isableFLS, /enableFLS, /state, /queryInstance, /newInstance] success.
    [INFO] FEDERATED(3944,2b280497ed00,python):2022-10-10-17:11:08.154.878 [mindspore_federated/fl_arch/ccsrc/scheduler/scheduler.cc:35] Run] Scheduler started successfully.
    [INFO] FEDERATED(3944,2b28c5ada700,python):2022-10-10-17:11:08.155.056 [mindspore_federated/fl_arch/ccsrc/common/communicator/http_request_handler.cc:90] Run] Start http server!
    ```

6. Start Worker

    `run_cross_silo_femnist_worker.py` is a Python script for starting a number of `worker`s, and supports modifying the configuration by the passing argument `argparse`. The following instruction is executed, representing the `worker` that starts this federated learning task, and the number of `workers` needed for the federated learning task to proceed properly is at least `2`.

    ```sh
    python run_cross_silo_fasterrcnn_worker.py --local_worker_num=2 --yaml_config="default_yaml_config.yaml" --pre_trained="/path/to/pre_trained" --dataset_path=/path/to/datasets/coco_split/split_100 --http_server_address=127.0.0.1:6668
    ```

    For the detailed implementation, see [run_cross_silo_femnist_worker.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/federated/blob/master/example/cross_silo_faster_rcnn/run_cross_silo_fasterrcnn_worker.py). Note that in dataset sink mode, the unit of the synchronization frequency of Cloud Federated is in epoch, otherwise the synchronization frequency is in step.

    As the above command, `--local_worker_num=2` means starting two clients, and the datasets used by the two clients are `datasets/coco_split/split_100/mindrecord_0` and `datasets/coco_split/split_100/mindrecord_1`. Please prepare the required datasets for the corresponding clients according to the `pre-task preparation` tutorial.

    After executing the above three commands and waiting for a while, go to the `worker_0` folder in the current directory and check the `worker_0` log with the command `grep -rn "\epoch:" *` and you will see a log message similar to the following:

    ```sh
    epoch: 1 step: 1 total_loss: 0.6060338
    ```

    Then it means that cross-silo federated is started successfully and `worker_0` is training. Other workers can be viewed in a similar way.

    At present, the 'worker' node of Cloud Federated supports the distributed training mode of single machine multi-card and multi-machine multi-card. `run_cross_silo_fasterrcnn_worker_distributed.py` is a python script for users to start distributed training of the worker node, and supports configuration modification via argparse. Execute the following instructions, representing the distributed 'worker' that starts this federated learning task, where 'device_num' represents the number of processes started by the 'worker' cluster, 'run_distribute' represents the distributed training started by the cluster, and its http start port is '6668'. Number of 'worker' processes is '4':

    ```sh
    python run_cross_silo_fasterrcnn_worker_distributed.py --device_num=4 --run_distribute=True --dataset_path=/path/to/datasets/coco_split/split_100 --http_server_address=127.0.0.1:6668
    ```

    Enter the 'worker_distributed/log_output/' folder in the current directory and run the 'grep -rn "epoch" *' command to view the logs of the 'worker' distributed cluster. You can see the following information:

    ```sh
    epoch: 1 step: 1 total_loss: 0.613467
    ```

    Please refer to [yaml configuration notes](https://www.mindspore.cn/federated/docs/en/master/horizontal/federated_server_yaml.html) for the description of parameter configuration in the above script.

### Viewing the Log

After successfully starting the task, the corresponding log file will be generated under the current directory `cross_silo_faster_rcnn`. The log file directory structure is as follows:

    └── worker.log        # Record the output logs during worker_1 participation in the federal learning task
```

### Closing the Mission

If you want to exit in the middle, the following command is available:

```sh
python finish_cross_silo_fasterrcnn.py --redis_port=2345
```

For the detailed implementation, see [finish_cloud.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/federated/blob/master/tests/st/cross_device_cloud/finish_cloud.py).

Or when the training task is finished, the cluster exits automatically, no need to close it manually.

### Results

- Use data：

  COCO dataset is split into 100 copies, and the first two copies are taken as two worker datasets respectively

- The number of client-side local training epochs: 1

- Total number of cross-silo federated learning iterations: 30

- Results (recording the loss values during the client-side local training):

  Go to the `worker_0` folder in the current directory, and check the `worker_0` log with the command `grep -rn "\]epoch:" *` to see the loss values output in each step:

  ```sh
  epoch: 1 step: 1 total_loss: 5.249325
  epoch: 1 step: 2 total_loss: 4.0856013
  epoch: 1 step: 3 total_loss: 2.6916502
  epoch: 1 step: 4 total_loss: 1.3917351
  epoch: 1 step: 5 total_loss: 0.8109232
  epoch: 1 step: 6 total_loss: 0.99101084
  epoch: 1 step: 7 total_loss: 1.7741735
  epoch: 1 step: 8 total_loss: 0.9517553
  epoch: 1 step: 9 total_loss: 1.7988946
  epoch: 1 step: 10 total_loss: 1.0213892
  epoch: 1 step: 11 total_loss: 1.1700443
                    .
                    .
                    .
  ```

The histograms of the training loss transformations in each step of worker_1 and worker_2 during the 30 iterations training are as follows, [1] and [2]:

The polygrams of the average loss (the sum of the losses of all the steps in an epoch divided by the number of steps) in each step of worker_1 and worker_2 during the 30 iterations training are as follows, [3] and [4]:
