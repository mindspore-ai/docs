# Device-Cloud Federated Learning Communication Compression

[![View Source On Gitee](https://mindspore-website.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/website-images/r2.0/resource/_static/logo_source_en.png)](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/r2.0/docs/federated/docs/source_en/communication_compression.md)

During the horizontal device-side federated learning training process, the traffic volume affects the user experience of the device-side (user traffic, communication latency, number of FL-Client participants) and is limited by the cloud-side performance constraints (memory, bandwidth, CPU usage). To improve user experience and reduce performance bottlenecks, MindSpore federated learning framework provides traffic compression for upload and download in device-cloud federated scenarios.

## Compression Method

### Upload Compression Method

The upload compression method can be divided into three main parts: weight difference codec, sparse codec and quantization codec. The flowcharts on FL-Client and FL-Server are given below.

### Weight Difference Codec

The weight difference is the vector difference of the weight matrix before and after the device-side training. Compared with the original weights, the distribution of the weight difference is more in line with the Gaussian distribution and therefore more suitable to be compressed. FL-Client performs the encoding operation on the weight difference, while FL-Server performs the decoding operation. Note that in order to reduce the weight difference to weights before FL-Server aggregates the weights, FL-Client does not multiply the weights by the amount of data when uploading the weights. When FL-Server decodes, it needs to multiply the weights by the amount of data.

### Sparse Codec

The device-side and cloud-side follow the same random algorithm to generate a sparse mask matrix that has the same shape as the original weights that need to be uploaded. The mask matrix contains only two values, 0 or 1. Each FL-Client only uploads data with the same weight as the non-zero value position of the mask matrix to the FL-Server.

Take the sparse method with a sparse rate of sparse_rate=0.08 as an example. The parameters that are required to be uploaded by FL-Client:

| Parameters               | Length  |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| albert.pooler.weight | 97344 |
| albert.pooler.bias   | 312   |
| classifier.weight    | 1560  |
| classifier.bias      | 5     |

Concatenate all parameters as one-dimensional vectors:

| Parameters  |     Length             |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| merged_data | 97344+312+1560+5=99221 |

Generate a mask vector with the same length as the concatenated parameter. There are 7937 values of 1, i.e., 7937 = int(sparse_rate*concatenated parameter length) and the rest have a value of 0, i.e., mask_vector = (1,1,1,... ,0,0,0,...):

| Parameters  |     Length   |
| ----------- | --------- |
| mask_vector | 99221 |

Use a pseudo-random algorithm to randomize the mask_vector. The random seed is the current number of iteration. Take out the indexes in the mask_vector with value 1. Take out the value of merged_data[indexes], i.e. the compressed vector.

| Parameters  |     Length   |
| ----------- | --------- |
| compressed_vector | 7937 |

After sparse compression, the parameter that FL-Client needs to upload is the compressed_vector.

After receiving the compressed_vector, FL-Server first constructs the mask vector mask_vector with the same pseudo-random algorithm and random seeds as FL-Client. Then it takes out the indexes with the value of 1 in the mask_vector. Generate the all-zero matrix with the same shape as the model. The values in compressed_vector are put into weight_vector[indexes] in turn. weight_vector is the sparsely decoded vector.

### Quantization Codec

The quantization compression method is approximating communication data fixed-point of floating-point type to a finite number of discrete values.

Taking the 8-bit quantization as an example:

Quantify the number of bits num_bits = 8

The floating-point data before compression is

data = [0.03356021, -0.01842778, -0.009684053, 0.025363436, -0.027571501, 0.0077043395, 0.016391572, -0.03598478,  -0.0009508357]

Compute the max and min values:

min_val = -0.03598478

max_val = 0.03356021

Calculate scaling factor:

scale = (max_val - min_val ) / (2 ^ num_bits - 1) = 0.000272725450980392

Convert the pre-compressed data to an integer between -128 and 127 with the conversion formula quant_data = round((data - min_val) / scale) - 2 ^ (num_bits - 1). And strongly convert the data type to int8:

quant_data = [127, -64, -32, 97, -97, 32, 64, -128, 0]

After the quantitative encoding, the parameters that FL-Client needs to upload are quant_data and the minimum and maximum values min_val and max_val.

After receiving quant_data, min_val and max_val, FL-Server uses the inverse quantization formula (quant_data + 2 ^ (num_bits - 1)) * (max_val - min_val) / (2 ^ num_bits - 1) + min_val to reduce the weights.

## Download Compression Method

The download compression method is mainly a quantization codec operation, and the flow charts on FL-Server and FL-Client are given below.

### Quantization Codec

The quantization codec is the same as that in upload compression.

## Code Implementation Preparation

To use the upload and download compression methods, first successfully complete the training aggregation process for either device or cloud federated scenario, e.g. [Implementing a Sentiment Classification Application (Android)](https://www.mindspore.cn/federated/docs/en/r0.1/sentiment_classification_application.html). The preparation work including datasets and network models and the simulation of the process to initiate multi-client participation in federated learning are described in detail in this document.

## Algorithm Open Script

The upload and download compression methods are currently only supported in the device-cloud federated learning scenario. The open method requires setting `upload_compress_type='DIFF_SPARSE_QUANT'` and `download_compress_type='QUANT'` in the corresponding yaml in the server startup script when starting the cloud-side service.

The relevant parameter configuration to start the algorithm is given in the cloud-side [full startup script](https://gitee.com/mindspore/federated/tree/r0.1/tests/st/cross_device_cloud/). After determining the parameter configuration, the user needs to configure the corresponding parameters before executing the training, as follows:

```yaml
compression:
  upload_compress_type: NO_COMPRESS
  upload_sparse_rate: 0.4
  download_compress_type: NO_COMPRESS
```

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| upload_compress_type   | Upload compression type, string type, including: "NO_COMPRESS", "DIFF_SPARSE_QUANT" |
| upload_sparse_rate     | Sparse ratio, i.e., weight retention, float type, defined in the domain (0, 1]            |
| download_compress_type | Download compression type, string type, including: "NO_COMPRESS", "QUANT"       |
