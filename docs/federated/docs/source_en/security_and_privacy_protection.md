# Model Security and Privacy

[![View Source On Gitee](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/raw/r1.5/resource/_static/logo_source_en.png)](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/r1.5/docs/federated/docs/source_en/security_and_privacy_protection.md)

During federated learning, user data is used only for local device training and does not need to be uploaded to the central server. This prevents personal data leakage.
However, in the conventional federated learning framework, models are migrated to the cloud in plaintext. There is still a risk of indirect disclosure of user privacy.
After obtaining the plaintext model uploaded by a user, the attacker can restore the user's personal training data through attacks such as reconstruction and model inversion. As a result, user privacy is disclosed.
As a federated learning framework, MindSpore Federated provides secure aggregation algorithms based on local differential privacy (LDP) and secure multi-party computation (MPC).
Noise addition or scrambling is performed on local models before they are migrated to the cloud. On the premise of ensuring the model availability, the problem of privacy leakage in horizontal federated learning is solved.

## LDP-based Secure Aggregation

### Principles

Differential privacy is a mechanism for protecting user data privacy. **Differential privacy** is defined as follows:

$$
Pr[\mathcal{K}(D)\in S] \le e^{\epsilon} Pr[\mathcal{K}(D') \in S]+\delta​
$$

For datasets $D and D'$ that have only one record difference, the random algorithm $\mathcal{K}$ is used to compute the probability of the $S$ subset, which meets the preceding formula. $\epsilon$ is the differential privacy budget, and $\delta$ is the perturbation. The smaller the values of $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, the closer the data distribution of $\mathcal{K}$ on $D$ and $D'$.

In horizontal federated learning, if the model weight matrix after local training on the client is $W$, the adversary can use $W$ to restore the training dataset[1] of the user because the model "remembers" the features of the training set during the training process. MindSpore Federated provides a LDP-based secure aggregation algorithm to prevent privacy data leakage when local models are migrated to the cloud. The MindSpore Federated client generates a differential noise matrix $G$ that has the same dimension as the local model $W$, and then adds the two to obtain a weight $W_p$ that meets the differential privacy definition:

$$
W_p=W+G
$$

The MindSpore Federated client uploads the noise-added model $W_p$ to the cloud server for federated aggregation. The noise matrix $G$ is equivalent to adding a layer of mask to the original model, which reduces the risk of sensitive data leakage from models and affects the convergence of model training. How to achieve a better balance between model privacy and usability is still a question worth studying. Experiments show that when the number of participants $n$ is large enough (generally more than 1000), most of the noises can cancel each other, and the LDP mechanism has no obvious impact on the accuracy and convergence of the aggregation model.

### Usage

Enabling differential privacy training is simple. You only need to perform the following operation during the cloud service startup.
Use `context.set_fl_context()` to set `encrypt_type='DP_ENCRYPT'`.
In addition, to control the effect of privacy protection, three parameters are provided: `dp_eps`, `dp_delta`, and `dp_norm_clip`.
They are also set through `context.set_fl_context()`. The valid value range of `dp_eps` and `dp_norm_clip` is greater than 0.
The value of `dp_delta` ranges between 0 and 1. Generally, the smaller the values of `dp_eps` and `dp_delta`, the better the privacy protection effect.
However, the impact on model convergence is greater. It is recommended that `dp_delta` be set to the reciprocal of the number of clients and the value of `dp_eps` be greater than 50.
`dp_norm_clip` is the adjustment coefficient of the model weight before noise is added to the model weight by the LDP mechanism. It affects the convergence of the model. The recommended value ranges from 0.5 to 2.

## MPC-based Secure Aggregation

### Principles

Although the LDP technology can properly protect user data privacy, when there are a relatively small quantity of participating clients or a Gaussian noise amplitude is relatively large, the model accuracy is greatly affected.
 To meet both model protection and model convergence requirements, we provide the MPC-based secure aggregation solution.
In this training mode, assuming that the participating client set is $U$, for any Federated-Client $u$ and $v$, they negotiate a pair of random perturbations $p_{uv}$ and $p_{vu}$, which meet the following condition:

$$
p_{uv}=\begin{cases} -p_{vu}, &u{\neq}v\\\\ 0, &u=v \end{cases}
$$

Therefore, each Federated-Client $u$ adds the perturbation negotiated with other users to the original model weight $x_u$ before uploading the model to the server:

$$
x_{encrypt}=x_u+\sum\limits_{v{\in}U}p_{uv}
$$

Therefore, the Federated-Server aggregation result $\overline{x}$ is as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
\overline{x}&=\sum\limits_{u{\in}U}(x_{u}+\sum\limits_{v{\in}U}p_{uv})\\\\
&=\sum\limits_{u{\in}U}x_{u}+\sum\limits_{u{\in}U}\sum\limits_{v{\in}U}p_{uv}\\\\
&=\sum\limits_{u{\in}U}x_{u}
\end{align}
$$

The preceding process describes only the main idea of the aggregation algorithm. The MPC-based aggregation solution is accuracy-lossless but increases the number of communication rounds.
If you are interested in the specific steps of the algorithm, refer to the paper[2].

### Usage

Similar to enabling differential privacy training, you only need to set `encrypt_type='PW_ENCRYPT'` in `context.set_fl_context()`.
In addition, the cloud environment parameters related to secure aggregation training include `share_secrets_ratio`, `reconstruct_secrets_threshold`, and `cipher_time_window`.
`share_client_ratio` indicates the ratio of the number of clients participating in key fragment sharing to the number of clients participating in federated learning. The value must be less than or equal to 1.
`reconstruct_secrets_threshold` indicates the number of clients that participate in key fragment reconstruction. The value must be less than the number of clients that participate in key fragment sharing.
To ensure system security, the `reconstruct_secrets_threshold` must be greater than half of the number of federated learning clients when the server and client are not colluded.
When the server and client are colluded, the value of `reconstruct_secrets_threshold` must be greater than two thirds of the number of federated learning clients.
`cipher_time_window` indicates the duration limit of each communication round for secure aggregation. It is used to ensure that the server can start a new round of iteration when some clients are offline.
It should be noted that only `server_num=1` is supported for current PW_ENCRYPT mode.
