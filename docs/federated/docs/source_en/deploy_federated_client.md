## Linux Compilation Guidance

### System Environment and Third-party Dependencies

This section describes how to complete the device-side compilation of MindSpore federated learning. Currently, the federated learning device-side only provides compilation guidance on Linux, and other systems are not supported. The following table lists the system environment and third-party dependencies required for compilation.

| Software Name                 | Version  |  Functions |
|-----------------------| ------------ | ------------ |
| Ubuntu                | 18.04.02LTS   | Compiling and running MindSpore operating system  |
| [GCC](#installing-gcc)         | Between 7.3.0 to 9.4.0  | C++ compiler for compiling MindSpore |
| [git](#installing-git)         | -  | Source code management tools used by MindSpore |
| [CMake](#installing-cmake)     | 3.18.3 and above  | Compiling and building MindSpore tools |
| [Gradle](#installing-gradle)   | 6.6.1  | JVM-based building tools  |
| [Maven](#installing-maven)     | 3.3.1 and above  | Tools for managing and building Java projects  |
| [OpenJDK](#installing-openjdk) | Between 1.8 to 1.15  | Tools for managing and building Java projects  |

### Compilation Options

The `cli_build.sh` script in the federated learning device_client directory is used for compilation on the federated learning device-side.

#### Instructions for Using cli_build.sh Parameters

| Parameters | Parameter Description                 | Value Range | Default Values       |
| ---- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| -p   | the download path of dependency external packages | string   | third |
| -c   | whether to reuse dependency packages previously downloaded | on and off  | on           |

### Compilation Examples

1. First, you need to download the source code from the gitee code repository before you can compile it.

    ```bash
    git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/federated.git ./
    ```

2. Go to the mindspore_federated/device_client directory and execute the following command:

    ```bash
    bash cli_build.sh
    ```

3. Since the end-side framework and the model are decoupled, the x86 architecture package we provide, mindspore-lite-{version}-linux-x64.tar.gz, does not contain model-related scripts, so the user needs to generate the jar package corresponding to the model scripts. The jar package corresponding to the model scripts we provide can be obtained in the following way:

    ```bash
    cd federated/example/quick_start_flclient
    bash build.sh -r mindspore-lite-java-flclient.jar # After -r, you need to give the absolute path to the latest x86 architecture package (generated in Step 2, federated/mindspore_federated/device_client/build/libs/jarX86/mindspore-lite-java-flclient.jar)
    ```

After running the above command, the path of generated jar package is federated/example/quick_start_flclient/target/quick_start_flclient.jar.

### Building Dependency Environment

1. After extracting the file `federated/mindspore_federated/device_client/third/mindspore-lite-{version}-linux-x64.tar.gz`, the obtained directory structure is as follows(files that are not used in federated  learning are not displayed here):

    ```sh
    mindspore-lite-{version}-linux-x64
    ├── tools
    └── runtime
        ├── include  # Header files of training framework
        ├── lib      # Training framework library
        │   ├── libminddata-lite.a          # Static library files for image processing
        │   ├── libminddata-lite.so        # Dynamic library files for image processing
        │   ├── libmindspore-lite-jni.so   # jni dynamic library relied by MindSpore Lite inference framework
        │   ├── libmindspore-lite-train.a  # Static library relied by MindSpore Lite training framework
        │   ├── libmindspore-lite-train.so # Dynamic library relied by MindSpore Lite training framework
        │   ├── libmindspore-lite-train-jni.so # jni dynamic library relied by MindSpore Lite training framework
        │   ├── libmindspore-lite.a  # Static library relied by MindSpore Lite inference framework
        │   ├── libmindspore-lite.so  # Dynamic library relied by MindSpore Lite inference framework
        │   ├── mindspore-lite-java.jar    # MindSpore Lite training framework jar package
        └── third_party
            ├── glog
            │└── libmindspore_glog.so.0   # Dynamic library files of glog
            └── libjpeg-turbo
                └── lib
                    ├── libjpeg.so.62   # Dynamic library files for image processing
                    └── libturbojpeg.so.0  # Dynamic library files for image processing
    ```

2. Put the so files relied by federated learning in paths `mindspore-lite-{version}-linux-x64/runtime/lib/`,  `mindspore-lite-{version}-linux-x64/runtime/third_party/glog/` and `mindspore-lite-{version}-linux-x64/runtime/third_party/libjpeg-turbo/lib/` in a folder, e.g. `/resource/x86libs/`. Then set the environment variables in x86 (absolute paths need to be provided below):

    ```sh
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/resource/x86libs/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

3. After setting up the dependency environment, you can simulate starting multiple clients in the x86 environment for federated learning by referring to the application practice tutorial [Implementing an end-cloud federation for image classification application (x86)](https://www.mindspore.cn/federated/docs/en/master/image_classification_application.html).
