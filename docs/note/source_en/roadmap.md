MindSpore's top priority plans in the year are displayed as follows. We will continuously adjust the priority based on user feedback.

In general, we will make continuous improvements in the following aspects:

1. Support more preset models.
2. Continuously supplement APIs and operator libraries to improve usability and programming experience.
3. Comprehensively support for Huawei Ascend AI processor and continuously optimize the performance and software architecture.
4. Improve visualization, debugging and optimization, and security-related tools.

We sincerely hope that you can join the discussion in the user community and contribute your suggestions.

## Preset Models
