# Operators

[![View Source On Gitee](./_static/logo_source.png)](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/r1.2/docs/programming_guide/source_en/operators.md)

## Overview

Operators of MindSpore can be classified based on the operator usage and operator functions. The following example code runs in PyNative mode.

## Operator Usage

APIs related to operators include operations, functional, and composite. Operators related to these three APIs can be directly obtained using ops.

- The operations API provides a single primitive operator. An operator corresponds to a primitive and is the smallest execution object. An operator can be used only after being instantiated.
- The composite API provides some predefined composite operators and complex operators involving graph transformation, such as `GradOperation`.
- The functional API provides objects instantiated by the operations and composite to simplify the operator calling process.

### mindspore.ops.operations

The operations API provides all primitive operator APIs, which are the lowest-order operator APIs open to users. For details about the supported operators, see [Operator List](https://www.mindspore.cn/doc/note/en/r1.2/operator_list.html).

Primitive operators directly encapsulate the implementation of operators at bottom layers such as Ascend, GPU, AICPU, and CPU, providing basic operator capabilities for users.

Primitive operator APIs are the basis for building high-order APIs, automatic differentiation, and network models.

A code example is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops.operations as P

input_x = mindspore.Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 4.0]), mindspore.float32)
input_y = 3.0
pow = P.Pow()
output = pow(input_x, input_y)
print("output =", output)
```

The following information is displayed:

```text
output = [ 1.  8. 64.]
```

### mindspore.ops.functional

To simplify the calling process of operators without attributes, MindSpore provides the functional version of some operators. For details about the input parameter requirements, see the input and output requirements of the original operator. For details about the supported operators, see [Operator List](https://www.mindspore.cn/doc/note/en/r1.2/operator_list_ms.html#mindspore-ops-functional).

For example, the functional version of the `P.Pow` operator is `F.tensor_pow`.

A code example is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore
from mindspore import Tensor
from mindspore.ops import functional as F

input_x = mindspore.Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 4.0]), mindspore.float32)
input_y = 3.0
output = F.tensor_pow(input_x, input_y)
print("output =", output)
```

The following information is displayed:

```text
output = [ 1.  8. 64.]
```

### mindspore.ops.composite

The composite API provides some operator combinations, including some operators related to clip_by_value and random, and functions (such as `GradOperation`, `HyperMap`, and `Map`) related to graph transformation.

The operator combination can be directly used as a common function. For example, use `normal` to generate a random distribution:

```python
from mindspore import dtype as mstype
from mindspore.ops import composite as C
from mindspore import Tensor

mean = Tensor(1.0, mstype.float32)
stddev = Tensor(1.0, mstype.float32)
output = C.normal((2, 3), mean, stddev, seed=5)
print("output =", output)
```

The following information is displayed:

```text
output = [[2.4911082  0.7941146  1.3117087]
 [0.30582333  1.772938  1.525996]]
```

> The preceding code runs on the GPU version of MindSpore.

For functions involving graph transformation, users can use `MultitypeFuncGraph` to define a group of overloaded functions. The implementation varies according to the function type.

A code example is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from mindspore.ops.composite import MultitypeFuncGraph
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops

add = MultitypeFuncGraph('add')
@add.register("Number", "Number")
def add_scalar(x, y):
    return ops.scalar_add(x, y)

@add.register("Tensor", "Tensor")
def add_tensor(x, y):
    return ops.add(x, y)

tensor1 = Tensor(np.array([[1.2, 2.1], [2.2, 3.2]]).astype('float32'))
tensor2 = Tensor(np.array([[1.2, 2.1], [2.2, 3.2]]).astype('float32'))
print('tensor', add(tensor1, tensor2))
print('scalar', add(1, 2))
```

The following information is displayed:

```text
tensor [[2.4 4.2]
 [4.4 6.4]]
scalar 3
```

In addition, the high-order function `GradOperation` provides the method of computing the gradient function corresponding to the input function. For details, see [mindspore.ops](https://www.mindspore.cn/doc/api_python/en/r1.2/mindspore/ops/mindspore.ops.GradOperation.html).

### Combination usage of operations/functional/composite three types of operators

In order to make it easier to use, in addition to the several usages introduced above, we have encapsulated the three operators of operations/functional/composite into mindspore.ops. It is recommended to directly call the interface in mindspore.ops.

The code sample is as follows:

```python
import mindspore.ops.operations as P
pow = P.Pow()
```

```python
import mindspore.ops as ops
pow = ops.Pow()
```

> The above two methods have the same effect.

## Operator Functions

Operators can be classified into seven functional modules: tensor operations, network operations, array operations, image operations, encoding operations, debugging operations, and quantization operations. For details about the supported operators on the Ascend AI processors, GPU, and CPU, see [Operator List](https://www.mindspore.cn/doc/note/en/r1.2/operator_list.html).

### Tensor Operations

The tensor operations include the tensor structure operation and the tensor mathematical operation.

Tensor structure operations include tensor creation, index sharding, dimension transformation, and integration and splitting.

Tensor mathematical operations include scalar operations, vector operations, and matrix operations.

The following describes how to use the tensor mathematical operation and operation broadcast mechanism.

### Scalar Operations

Tensor mathematical operators can be classified into scalar operator, vector operator, and matrix operator.

Scalar operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, common functions such as trigonometric function, exponential function, and logarithmic function, and logical comparison operators.

Scalar operators are characterized by performing element-by-element operations on tensors.

Some scalar operators overload commonly used mathematical operators. In addition, the broadcast feature similar to NumPy is supported.

 The following code implements the exponentiation, where the base is input_x and the exponent is input_y:

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore
from mindspore import Tensor

input_x = mindspore.Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 4.0]), mindspore.float32)
input_y = 3.0
print(input_x**input_y)
```

 The following information is displayed:

```text
[ 1.  8. 64.]
```

#### Addition

The following code implements the addition of `input_x` and `input_y`:

```python
print(input_x + input_y)
```

 The following information is displayed:

```text
[4. 5. 7.]
```

#### Element-wise Multiplication

The following code implements the element-wise multiplication:

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops

input_x = Tensor(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), mindspore.float32)
input_y = Tensor(np.array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]), mindspore.float32)
mul = ops.Mul()
res = mul(input_x, input_y)

print(res)
```

 The following information is displayed:

```text
[4. 10. 18.]
```

#### Trigonometric Function

The following code implements Acos:

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops

acos = ops.ACos()
input_x = Tensor(np.array([0.74, 0.04, 0.30, 0.56]), mindspore.float32)
output = acos(input_x)
print(output)
```

 The following information is displayed:

```text
[0.7377037 1.5307858 1.2661037 0.97641146]
```

### Vector Operations

Vector operators perform operations on only one particular axis, mapping a vector to a scalar or another vector.

#### Squeeze

The following code implements the compression of a channel whose dimension of the third channel is 1:

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops

input_tensor = Tensor(np.ones(shape=[3, 2, 1]), mindspore.float32)
squeeze = ops.Squeeze(2)
output = squeeze(input_tensor)

print(output)
```

 The following information is displayed:

```text
[[1. 1.]
 [1. 1.]
 [1. 1.]]
```

### Matrix Operations

Matrix operations include matrix multiplication, matrix norm, matrix determinant, matrix eigenvalue calculation, and matrix decomposition.

input_x = Tensor(np.ones(shape=[1, 3]), mindspore.float32)
input_y = Tensor(np.ones(shape=[3, 4]), mindspore.float32)
matmul = ops.MatMul()
output = matmul(input_x, input_y)

print(output)
```

The following information is displayed:

```text
[[3. 3. 3. 3.]]
```

#### Broadcast Mechanism

Broadcast indicates that when the number of channels of each input variable is inconsistent, change the number of channels to obtain the result.

- The following code implements the broadcast mechanism:

```python
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops
import numpy as np

shape = (2, 3)
input_x = Tensor(np.array([1, 2, 3]).astype(np.float32))
broadcast_to = ops.BroadcastTo(shape)
output = broadcast_to(input_x)

print(output)
```

The following information is displayed:

```text
[[1. 2. 3.]
 [1. 2. 3.]]
```

### Network Operations

Network operations include feature extraction, activation function, loss function, and optimization algorithm.

#### Feature Extraction

Feature extraction is a common operation in machine learning. The core of feature extraction is to extract more representative tensors than the original input.

conv2d = ops.Conv2D(out_channel=32, kernel_size=3)
res = conv2d(input, weight)

print(res)
```

```

### Array Operations

Array operations refer to operations on arrays.

#### DType

Returns a Tensor variable that has the same data type as the input and adapts to MindSpore. It is usually used in a MindSpore project.

The following is a code example:

```python
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops
import numpy as np
import mindspore

input_tensor = Tensor(np.array([[2, 2], [2, 2]]), mindspore.float32)

The following is a code example:

```python
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops
import numpy as np
import mindspore

input_np = np.random.randn(2, 3, 4, 5).astype(np.float32)
input_x = Tensor(input_np)
type_dst = mindspore.float16
cast = ops.Cast()
result = cast(input_x, type_dst)
print(result.dtype)
```

 The following information is displayed:

```text
Float16
```

#### Shape

Returns the shape of the input data.

 The following code implements the operation of returning the input data input_tensor:

```python
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops
import numpy as np
import mindspore

input_tensor = Tensor(np.ones(shape=[3, 2, 1]), mindspore.float32)
shape = ops.Shape()
output = shape(input_tensor)
print(output)
```

 The following information is displayed:

```text
(3, 2, 1)
```

### Image Operations

> The preceding code runs on MindSpore of the Ascend version.

### Encoding Operations

The encoding operations include BoundingBox Encoding, BoundingBox Decoding, and IOU computing.

#### BoundingBoxEncode

The box of the area where the object is located is encoded to obtain more concise information similar to PCA, facilitating subsequent tasks such as feature extraction, object detection, and image restoration.

The following code implements BoundingBox Encoding for anchor_box and groundtruth_box:

```python
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops
import mindspore

anchor_box = Tensor([[2,2,2,3],[2,2,2,3]],mindspore.float32)
groundtruth_box = Tensor([[1,2,1,4],[1,2,1,4]],mindspore.float32)
boundingbox_encode = ops.BoundingBoxEncode(means=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), stds=(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0))
res = boundingbox_encode(anchor_box, groundtruth_box)
print(res)
```

 The following information is displayed:

```text
[[-1.          0.25        0.          0.40546513]
 [-1.          0.25        0.          0.40546513]]
```

#### BoundingBoxDecode

After decoding the area location information, the encoder uses this operator to decode the information.

 Code implementation:

```python
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops
import mindspore

anchor_box = Tensor([[4,1,2,1],[2,2,2,3]],mindspore.float32)
deltas = Tensor([[3,1,2,2],[1,2,1,4]],mindspore.float32)
boundingbox_decode = ops.BoundingBoxDecode(means=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), stds=(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0), max_shape=(768, 1280), wh_ratio_clip=0.016)
res = boundingbox_decode(anchor_box, deltas)
print(res)
```

 The following information is displayed:

```text
[[ 4.194528   0.         0.         5.194528 ]
 [ 2.1408591  0.         3.8591409 60.59815  ]]
```

#### IOU Computing

Computes the proportion of the intersection area and union area of the box where the predicted object is located and the box where the real object is located. It is often used as a loss function to optimize the model.

The following code implements the IOU computing between `anchor_boxes` and `gt_boxes`. The output is stored in out:

```python
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops
import numpy as np
import mindspore

iou = ops.IOU()
anchor_boxes = Tensor(np.random.randint(1.0, 5.0, [3, 4]), mindspore.float16)
gt_boxes = Tensor(np.random.randint(1.0, 5.0, [3, 4]), mindspore.float16)
out = iou(anchor_boxes, gt_boxes)
print(out)
```

 The following information is displayed:

```text
[[ 0. -0.  0.]
 [ 0. -0.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.]]
```

### Debugging Operations

The debugging operations refer to some common operators and operations used to debug a network, for example, HookBackward. These operations are very convenient and important for entry-level deep learning, greatly improving learning experience.

#### HookBackward

Displays the gradient of intermediate variables. It is a common operator. Currently, only the PyNative mode is supported.

The following code implements the function of printing the gradient of the intermediate variable (x,y in this example):

```python
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops
import numpy as np
from mindspore import dtype as mstype

def hook_fn(grad_out):
    print(grad_out)

grad_all = ops.GradOperation(get_all=True)
hook = ops.HookBackward(hook_fn)

def hook_test(x, y):
    z = x * y
    z = hook(z)
    z = z * y
    return z

def backward(x, y):
    return grad_all(hook_test)(Tensor(x, mstype.float32), Tensor(y, mstype.float32))

print(backward(1, 2))
```

The following information is displayed:

```text
(Tensor(shape=[], dtype=Float32, value= 2),)
(Tensor(shape=[], dtype=Float32, value= 4), Tensor(shape=[], dtype=Float32, value= 4))
```
