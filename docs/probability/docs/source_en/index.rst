MindSpore Probability Documents
===================================

MindSpore Probability is a fusion suite seamlessly integrating Bayesian learning and deep learning, which provides a comprehensive probability learning library for building probability models and applying Bayesian inference.

A deep learning model has a strong fitting capability, and the Bayesian theory has a good explainability.

MindSpore Probability provides the following functions:

- Abundant statistical distribution and common probabilistic inference algorithms
- Combinable probabilistic programming modules for developers to use the logic of the deep learning model to build a deep probabilistic model
