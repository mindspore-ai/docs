This document describes how to quickly install MindSpore Nightly by pip in a Linux system with a CPU environment.

For details about how to install third-party dependency software when confirming the system environment information, see the third-party dependency software installation section in the [Installing MindSpore Using Source Code Build on Windows (CPU)](https://www.mindspore.cn/news/newschildren?id=364) provided by the community.

## System Environment Information Confirmation

- Ensure that Windows 10 is installed with the x86 architecture 64-bit operating system.
- Ensure that you have Python versions between 3.7 to 3.9 installed. If not installed, follow the links to [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) or [Huawei Cloud](https://repo.huaweicloud.com/python/) to download and install Python.
- After installing Python, add Python and pip to the system environment variable.
    - Add Python: Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables. Double click the Path in the system variable and add the path of `python.exe`.
    - Add pip: The `Scripts` folder in the same directory of `python.exe` is the pip file that comes with Python, and add it to the system environment variable.

## Installing MindSpore

Execute the following command to install MindSpore:

```bash
pip install mindspore-dev -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

Of which,

- When the network is connected, dependency items are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. (For details about the dependency, see required_package in [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.9/setup.py) .) In other cases, you need to install it by yourself. When running models, you need to install additional dependencies based on requirements.txt specified for different models in [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/r1.9/). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.9/requirements.txt).
- pip will be installing the latest version of MindSpore Nightly automatically. If you wish to specify the version to be installed, please refer to the instruction below regarding to version update, and specify version manually.

## Installation Verification

```bash
python -c "import mindspore;mindspore.run_check()"
```

The outputs should be the same as:

```text
MindSpore version: __version__
The result of multiplication calculation is correct, MindSpore has been installed successfully!
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

## Version Update

Use the following command if you need to update the MindSpore version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade mindspore-dev=={version}
```

Of which,

- When updating to a release candidate (rc) version, `{version}` should be specified manually, e.g. 1.6.0rc1.dev20211125; When automatically updating to the latest version, `=={version}` could be removed.
