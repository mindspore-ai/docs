(For details about the dependency, see required_package in [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r2.0.0-alpha/setup.py) .) In other cases, you need to install it by yourself. When running models, you need to install additional dependencies based on requirements.txt specified for different models in [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/r2.0/).

```bash
python -c "import mindspore;mindspore.run_check()"
