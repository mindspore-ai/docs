[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is an open-source, cross-platform, language-agnostic package manager and environment management system. It allows users to easily install different versions of binary software packages and any required libraries appropriate for their computing platform.

This document describes how to quickly install MindSpore in a Linux system with an Ascend 910 environment by Conda.

## System Environment Information Confirmation

- Ensure that a 64-bit operating system is installed and the [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) version is 2.17 or later, where Ubuntu 18.04, CentOS 7.6, EulerOS 2.8, openEuler 20.03, and Kylin V10 SP1 are verified.
- Ensure that right version [GCC 7.3.0](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-7.3.0/gcc-7.3.0.tar.gz) is installed.
- Ensure that [gmp 6.1.2](https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.1.2.tar.xz) is installed.
- Ensure that [OpenMPI 4.0.3](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building#easy-build) is installed. (optional, required for single-node/multi-Ascend and multi-node/multi-Ascend training)

- Ensure that the Conda version is compatible with the current system.

    - If you prefer the complete capabilities provided by Conda, you can choose to download [Anaconda3](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/).
    - If you want to save disk space or prefer custom Conda installation, you can choose to download [Miniconda3](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/).

- Ensure that the Ascend AI processor software package (Ascend Data Center Solution 21.0.4) are installed, please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/zh/doc/EDOC1100235797?section=j003).

    - Ensure that the current user has the right to access the installation path `/usr/local/Ascend`of Ascend AI processor software package, If not, the root user needs to add the current user to the user group where `/usr/local/Ascend` is located. For the specific configuration, please refer to the software package instruction document.

    - Install the .whl package provided in Ascend AI processor software package. The .whl package is released with the software package. After software package is upgraded, reinstall the .whl package.

        ```bash
        pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64/topi-{version}-py3-none-any.whl
        pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64/te-{version}-py3-none-any.whl
        pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64/hccl-{version}-py3-none-any.whl
        ```

    - If the Ascend AI processor software package is upgraded, the .whl package also needs to be reinstalled, first uninstall the original installation package, and then refer to the above command to reinstall.

        ```bash
        pip uninstall te topi hccl -y
        ```

## Creating and Accessing the Conda Virtual Environment

Create a Conda virtual environment based on the Python version you want to use and go to the virtual environment.
If you want to use Python 3.7.5:

```bash
conda create -n mindspore_py37 -c conda-forge python=3.7.5
conda activate mindspore_py37
```

If you want to use Python 3.9.0:

```bash
conda create -n mindspore_py39 -c conda-forge python=3.9.0
conda activate mindspore_py39
```

Install the .whl package provided with the Ascend AI Processor software package in the virtual environment. The .whl package is released with the software package. After the software package is upgraded, you need to reinstall the .whl package.

```bash
pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64/topi-{version}-py3-none-any.whl
pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64/te-{version}-py3-none-any.whl
pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64/hccl-{version}-py3-none-any.whl
```

If the software package of the Ascend AI processor is upgraded, the matching .whl package also needs to be reinstalled. Uninstall the original installation package and reinstall the .whl package by referring to the preceding commands.

```bash
pip uninstall te topi hccl -y
```

## Installing MindSpore

Execute the following command to install MindSpore.

```bash
conda install mindspore-ascend={version} -c mindspore -c conda-forge
```

In the preceding information:

- When the network is connected, dependency items are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. (For details about the dependency, see required_package in [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.6/setup.py) .) In other cases, you need to install it by yourself. When running models, you need to install additional dependencies based on requirements.txt specified for different models in [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/r1.6/). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.6/requirements.txt).
- `{version}` denotes the version of MindSpore. For example, when you are installing MindSpore 1.5.0-rc1, `{version}` should be 1.5.0rc1.

## Configuring Environment Variables

**If Ascend AI processor software is installed in a non-default path**, after MindSpore is installed, export runtime-related environment variables. `/usr/local/Ascend` in the following command `LOCAL_ASCEND=/usr/local/Ascend` denotes the installation path of the software package, please replace it as your actual installation path.

```bash
# control log level. 0-DEBUG, 1-INFO, 2-WARNING, 3-ERROR, 4-CRITICAL, default level is WARNING.
export GLOG_v=2

# Conda environmental options
LOCAL_ASCEND=/usr/local/Ascend # the root directory of run package

# lib libraries that the run package depends on
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64:${LOCAL_ASCEND}/driver/lib64:${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp/op_impl/built-in/ai_core/tbe/op_tiling:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# Environment variables that must be configured
export TBE_IMPL_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp/op_impl/built-in/ai_core/tbe            # TBE operator implementation tool path
export ASCEND_OPP_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp                                       # OPP path
export PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/ccec_compiler/bin/:${PATH}                 # TBE operator compilation tool path
export PYTHONPATH=${TBE_IMPL_PATH}:${PYTHONPATH}                                                # Python library that TBE implementation depends on
```

## Installation Verification

i:

```bash
python -c "import mindspore;mindspore.run_check()"
```

- The outputs should be the same as:

```text
MindSpore version: __version__
The result of multiplication calculation is correct, MindSpore has been installed successfully!
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

ii:

```python
import numpy as np
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops
import mindspore.context as context

context.set_context(device_target="Ascend")
x = Tensor(np.ones([1,3,3,4]).astype(np.float32))
y = Tensor(np.ones([1,3,3,4]).astype(np.float32))
print(ops.add(x, y))
```

- The outputs should be the same as:

```text
[[[[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]

  [[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]

  [[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]]]
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

## Version Update

Using the following command if you need to update the MindSpore version:

```bash
conda update mindspore-ascend -c mindspore -c conda-forge
```
