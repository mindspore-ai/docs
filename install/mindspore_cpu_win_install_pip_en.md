This document describes how to quickly install MindSpore by pip in a Windows system with a CPU environment.

## System Environment Information Confirmation

- Confirm that Windows 10 is installed with the x86 architecture 64-bit operating system.
- Confirm that Python 3.7.5 is installed.  
    - If you didn't install Python or you have installed other versions, please download the Python 3.7.5 64-bit from [Huaweicloud](https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/python/3.7.5/Python-3.7.5.tgz) to install.
- After installing Python, add Python and pip to the environment variable.
    - Add Python: Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables. Double click the Path in the environment variable and add the path of `python.exe`.
    - Add pip: The `Scripts` folder in the same directory of `python.exe` is the pip file that comes with Python, add it to the system environment variable.

## Installing MindSpore

It is recommended to refer to [Version List](https://www.mindspore.cn/versions/en) to perform SHA-256 integrity verification, and then execute the following command to install MindSpore after the verification is consistent.

```bash
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/{version}/MindSpore/cpu/x86_64/mindspore-{version}-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

Of which,

- When the network is connected, dependency items are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. (For details about the dependency, see required_package in [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.3/setup.py) .) In other cases, you need to install it by yourself. When running models, you need to install additional dependencies based on requirements.txt specified for different models in [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/r1.3/model_zoo). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.3/requirements.txt).
- `{version}` denotes the version of MindSpore. For example, when you are installing MindSpore 1.1.0, `{version}` should be 1.1.0.

## Installation Verification

```bash
python -c "import mindspore;mindspore.run_check()"
```

The outputs should be the same as:

```text
mindspore version: __version__
The result of multiplication calculation is correct, MindSpore has been installed successfully!
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

## Version Update

Using the following command if you need to update the MindSpore version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade mindspore
```
