This document describes how to install MindSpore by pip on Windows in a CPU environment.

## System Environment Information Confirmation

- Ensure that Windows 10 is installed with the x86 architecture 64-bit operating system.
- Ensure that you have Python(>=3.9.0) installed. If not installed, follow the links to [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) or [Huawei Cloud](https://repo.huaweicloud.com/python/) to download and install Python.

## Installing MindSpore

First, refer to [Version List](https://www.mindspore.cn/versions) to select the version of MindSpore you want to install, and perform SHA-256 integrity check. Taking version 2.5.0 as an example, execute the following commands.

```bash
set MS_VERSION=2.5.0
```

Then run the following commands to install MindSpore according to Python version.

```bash
# Python3.9
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/%MS_VERSION%/MindSpore/cpu/x86_64/mindspore-%MS_VERSION:-=%-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# Python3.10
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/%MS_VERSION%/MindSpore/cpu/x86_64/mindspore-%MS_VERSION:-=%-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# Python3.11
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/%MS_VERSION%/MindSpore/cpu/x86_64/mindspore-%MS_VERSION:-=%-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

When the network is connected, dependency items are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. (For details about the dependency, see required_package in [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/v2.6.0-rc1/setup.py)). In other cases, you need to install dependency by yourself.

## Installation Verification

Execute the following command:

```bash
python -c "import mindspore;mindspore.set_device(device_target='CPU');mindspore.run_check()"
```

The outputs should be the same as:

```text
MindSpore version: __version__
The result of multiplication calculation is correct, MindSpore has been installed on platform [CPU] successfully!
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

## Version Update

Use the following command if you need to update the MindSpore version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade mindspore=={version}
```

Of which,

- When updating to a release candidate (RC) version, set `{version}` to the RC version number, for example, 2.0.0.rc1. When updating to a stable release, you can remove `=={version}`.
