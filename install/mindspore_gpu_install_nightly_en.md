The following describes how to install the third-party dependencies.

### Installing CUDA

MindSpore GPU supports CUDA 10.1 and CUDA 11.1. NVIDIA officially shows a variety of installation methods. For details, please refer to [CUDA download page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) and [CUDA installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html).
The following only shows instructions for installing by runfile on Linux systems.

Before installing CUDA, you need to run the following commands to install related dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) gcc-7
```

The minimum required GPU driver version of CUDA 10.1 is 418.39. The minimum required GPU driver version of CUDA 11.1 is 450.80.02. You may run `nvidia-smi` command to confirm the GPU driver version. If the driver version does not meet the requirements, you should choose to install the driver during the CUDA installation. After installing the driver, you need to reboot your system.

Run the following command to install CUDA 11.1 (recommended).

```bash
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/11.1.1/local_installers/cuda_11.1.1_455.32.00_linux.run
sudo sh cuda_11.1.1_455.32.00_linux.run
echo -e "export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.1/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
echo -e "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.1/lib64:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Or install CUDA 10.1 with the following command.

```bash
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.1/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.1.243_418.87.00_linux.run
sudo sh cuda_10.1.243_418.87.00_linux.run
echo -e "export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.1/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
echo -e "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.1/lib64:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

When the default path /usr/local/cuda has an installation package, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable does not work. The reason is that MindSpore uses DT_RPATH to support startup without environment variables, reducing user settings. DT_RPATH has a higher priority than the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

### Installing cuDNN

After completing the installation of CUDA, Log in and download the corresponding cuDNN installation package from [cuDNN page](https://developer.nvidia.com/zh-cn/cudnn). If CUDA 10.1 was previously installed, download cuDNN v7.6.x for CUDA 10.1. If CUDA 11.1 was previously installed, download cuDNN v8.0.x for CUDA 11.1. Note that download the tgz compressed file. Assuming that the downloaded cuDNN package file is named `cudnn.tgz` and the installed CUDA version is 11.1, execute the following command to install cuDNN.

```bash
tar -zxvf cudnn.tgz
sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda-11.1/include
sudo cp cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda-11.1/lib64
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda-11.1/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda-11.1/lib64/libcudnn*
```

If a different version of CUDA have been installed or the CUDA installation path is different, just replace `/usr/local/cuda-11.1` in the above command with the currently installed CUDA path.

### Installing Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) can be installed in multiple ways.

- Install Python with Conda.

  Install Miniconda:

  ```bash
  cd /tmp
  curl -O https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-$(arch).sh
  bash Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-$(arch).sh -b
  cd -
  . ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
  conda init bash
  ```

  After the installation is complete, you can set up Tsinghua source acceleration download for Conda, and see [here](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/anaconda/).

  Create a virtual environment, taking Python 3.7.5 as an example:

  ```bash
  conda create -n mindspore_py37 python=3.7.5 -y
  conda activate mindspore_py37
  ```

- Or install Python via APT with the following command.

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install software-properties-common -y
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa -y
  sudo apt-get install python3.7 python3.7-dev python3.7-distutils python3-pip -y
  # set new installed Python as default
  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.7 100
  # install pip
  python -m pip install pip -i https://repo.huaweicloud.com/repository/pypi/simple
  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/pip pip ~/.local/bin/pip3.7 100
  pip config set global.index-url https://repo.huaweicloud.com/repository/pypi/simple
  ```

  To install other Python versions, just change `3.7` in the command.

Run the following command to check the Python version.

```bash
python --version
```

### Installing GCC

Run the following commands to install GCC.

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc -y
```

### Installing TensorRT-optional

After completing the installation of CUDA and cuDNN, download TensorRT 7.2.2 for CUDA 11.1 from [TensorRT download page](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-tensorrt-7x-download), and note to download installation package in TAR format. Suppose the downloaded file is named `TensorRT-7.2.2.3.Ubuntu-18.04.x86_64-gnu.cuda-11.1.cudnn8.0.tar.gz`, install TensorRT with the following command.

```bash
tar xzf TensorRT-7.2.2.3.Ubuntu-18.04.x86_64-gnu.cuda-11.1.cudnn8.0.tar.gz
cd TensorRT-7.2.2.3
echo -e "export TENSORRT_HOME=$PWD" >> ~/.bashrc
echo -e "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\$TENSORRT_HOME/lib:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
cd -
```

## Installing MindSpore

For CUDA 11.1:

```bash
pip install mindspore-cuda11-dev -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

Of which,

- Currently, MindSpore GPU Nightly only provides CUDA11 version.
- When the network is connected, dependency items are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. (For details about the dependency, see required_package in [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.10/setup.py) .) In other cases, you need to install it by yourself. When running models, you need to install additional dependencies based on requirements.txt specified for different models in [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/r1.10/). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.10/requirements.txt).
- pip will be installing the latest version of MindSpore GPU Nightly automatically. If you wish to specify the version to be installed, please refer to the instruction below regarding to version update, and specify version manually.

## Installation Verification

Before running MindSpore GPU version, please make sure that installation path of nvcc has been added to `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variabels. If you have not done so, please follow the example below, based on CUDA11 installed in default location:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.1/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.1/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

If a different version of CUDA have been installed or the CUDA installation path is different, replace `/usr/local/cuda-11.1` in the above command with the currently installed CUDA path.

i:

```bash
python -c "import mindspore;mindspore.run_check()"
```

The outputs should be the same as:

```text
MindSpore version: __version__
The result of multiplication calculation is correct, MindSpore has been installed successfully!
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

ii:

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore as ms
import mindspore.ops as ops

ms.set_context(device_target="GPU")
x = ms.Tensor(np.ones([1,3,3,4]).astype(np.float32))
y = ms.Tensor(np.ones([1,3,3,4]).astype(np.float32))
print(ops.add(x, y))
```

- The outputs should be the same as:

```text
[[[[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]

  [[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]

  [[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]]]
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

## Version Update

Use the following command if you need to update the MindSpore version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade mindspore-cuda11-dev=={version}
```

Of which,

- When updating to a release candidate (rc) version, `{version}` should be specified manually, e.g. 1.6.0rc1.dev20211125; When you want to upgrade to the latest version automatically, `=={version}` could be removed.

Note: Currently MindSpore GPU nightly is only available in the CUDA11 version. If you still want to use the CUDA10 version, please refer to the source code compilation guide to compile it yourself on the environment where CUDA10 is installed.
