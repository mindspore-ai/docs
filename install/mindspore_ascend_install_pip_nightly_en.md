MindSpore Nightly is a preview version which includes latest features and bugfixes, not fully supported and tested. Install MindSpore Nightly version if you wish to try out the latest features or bug fixes can use this version.

This document describes how to install MindSpore by pip on Linux in an Ascend 910 environment.

## Installing MindSpore and dependencies

The following table lists the system environment and third-party dependencies required for installing MindSpore.

|Software|Version|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Ubuntu 18.04/CentOS 7.6/EulerOS 2.8/openEuler 20.03/KylinV10 SP1|-|OS for running MindSpore|
|[Python](#installing-python)|3.7-3.9|Python environment that MindSpore depends on|
|[Ascend AI processor software package](#installing-ascend-ai-processor-software-package)|-|Ascend platform AI computing library used by MindSpore|
|[GCC](#installing-gcc)|7.3.0|C++ compiler for compiling MindSpore|

The following describes how to install the third-party dependencies.

### Installing Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) can be installed by Conda.

Install Miniconda:

```bash
cd /tmp
curl -O https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-$(arch).sh
bash Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-$(arch).sh -b
cd -
. ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda init bash
```

After the installation is complete, you can set up Tsinghua source acceleration download for Conda, and see [here](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/anaconda/).

Create a virtual environment, taking Python 3.7.5 as an example:

```bash
conda create -n mindspore_py37 python=3.7.5 -y
conda activate mindspore_py37
```

Run the following command to check the Python version.

```bash
python --version
```

If you are using ARM architecture, ensure that pip installed for current Python is 19.3 or later. If not, upgrade pip using the following command.

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
```

### Installing Ascend AI processor software package

Ascend software package provides two distributions, commercial edition and community edition:

- Commercial edition needs approval from Ascend to download, for detailed installation guide, please refer to [Ascend Training Solution 23.0.RC3 Installation Guide (TBD)].

- Community edition has no restrictions, choose `7.0.RC1.alpha005` in [CANN community edition](https://www.hiascend.com/developer/download/community/result?module=cann), then choose relevant driver and firmware packages in [firmware and driver](https://www.hiascend.com/hardware/firmware-drivers/community). Please refer to the abovementioned commercial edition installation guide to choose which packages are to be installed and how to install them.

The default installation path of the installation package is `/usr/local/Ascend`. Ensure that the current user has the right to access the installation path of Ascend AI processor software package. If not, the root user needs to add the current user to the user group where `/usr/local/Ascend` is located.

Install the .whl packages provided in Ascend AI processor software package. If the .whl packages have been installed before, you should uninstall the .whl packages by running the following command.

```bash
pip uninstall te topi hccl -y
```

Run the following command to install the .whl packages if the Ascend AI package has been installed in default path. If the installation path is not the default path, you need to replace the path in the command with the installation path.

```bash
pip install sympy
pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/lib64/te-*-py3-none-any.whl
pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/lib64/hccl-*-py3-none-any.whl
```

The LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable does not work when the installation package exists in the default path. The default path priority is: /usr/local/Ascend/nnae is higher than /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit. The reason is that MindSpore uses DT_RPATH to support startup without environment variables, reducing user settings. DT_RPATH has a higher priority than the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

### Installing GCC

- On Ubuntu 18.04, run the following commands to install.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install gcc-7 -y
    ```

- On CentOS 7, run the following commands to install.

    ```bash
    sudo yum install centos-release-scl
    sudo yum install devtoolset-7
    ```

    After installation, run the following commands to switch to GCC 7.

    ```bash
    scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
    ```

- On EulerOS and openEuler, run the following commands to install.

    ```bash
    sudo yum install gcc -y
    ```

### Installing MindSpore

Execute the following command to install MindSpore:

```bash
pip install mindspore-dev -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

Of which,

- When the network is connected, dependencies are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. (For details about the dependencies, see required_package in [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/master/setup.py).) In other cases, you need to install it by yourself. When running models, you need to install additional dependencies based on requirements.txt specified for different models in [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/master/requirements.txt).
- pip will be installing the latest version of MindSpore Nightly automatically. If you wish to specify the version to be installed, please refer to the instruction below regarding to version update, and specify version manually.

## Configuring Environment Variables

**If Ascend AI processor software is installed in a non-default path**, after MindSpore is installed, export runtime-related environment variables. `/usr/local/Ascend` in the following command `LOCAL_ASCEND=/usr/local/Ascend` denotes the installation path of the software package, and you need to replace it as the actual installation path of the software package.

```bash
# control log level. 0-DEBUG, 1-INFO, 2-WARNING, 3-ERROR, 4-CRITICAL, default level is WARNING.
export GLOG_v=2

# Conda environmental options
LOCAL_ASCEND=/usr/local/Ascend # the root directory of run package

# lib libraries that the run package depends on
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/lib64:${LOCAL_ASCEND}/driver/lib64:${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp/op_impl/built-in/ai_core/tbe/op_tiling:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# Environment variables that must be configured
## TBE operator implementation tool path
export TBE_IMPL_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp/op_impl/built-in/ai_core/tbe
## OPP path
export ASCEND_OPP_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp
## AICPU path
export ASCEND_AICPU_PATH=${ASCEND_OPP_PATH}/..
## TBE operator compilation tool path
export PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/compiler/ccec_compiler/bin/:${PATH}
## Python library that TBE implementation depends on
export PYTHONPATH=${TBE_IMPL_PATH}:${PYTHONPATH}
```

## Installation Verification

i:

```bash
python -c "import mindspore;mindspore.run_check()"
```

The outputs should be the same as:

```text
MindSpore version: __version__
The result of multiplication calculation is correct, MindSpore has been installed on platform [Ascend] successfully!
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

ii:

```python
import numpy as np
import mindspore as ms
import mindspore.ops as ops

ms.set_context(device_target="Ascend")
x = ms.Tensor(np.ones([1,3,3,4]).astype(np.float32))
y = ms.Tensor(np.ones([1,3,3,4]).astype(np.float32))
print(ops.add(x, y))
```

The outputs should be the same as:

```text
[[[[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]

  [[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]

  [[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]]]
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

## Version Update

When upgrading from MindSpore 1.x to MindSpore 2.x, you need to manually uninstall the old version first:

```bash
pip uninstall mindspore-ascend-dev
```

Then install MindSpore 2.x:

```bash
pip install mindspore-dev=={version}
```

When upgrading from MindSpore 2.x:

```bash
pip install --upgrade mindspore-dev=={version}
```

Of which,

- When updating to a release candidate (RC) version, set `{version}` to the RC version number, for example, 2.0.0.rc1. When updating to a stable release, you can remove `=={version}`.
