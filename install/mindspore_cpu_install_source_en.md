This document describes how to quickly install MindSpore by source code compilation in a Linux system in the CPU environment. The following takes Ubuntu 18.04 as an example to describe how to compile and install MindSpore.

- If you need to configure an environment for building MindSpore on the Ubuntu 18.04 that never installed MindSpore and its dependencies, you may use the [automatic installation script](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/raw/r1.9/scripts/install/ubuntu-cpu-source.sh) for one-click configuration, see [Environment Preparation -automatic, recommended](#environment-preparation-automatic-recommended) section. The script installs the dependencies required for building MindSpore.

- If some dependencies, such as Python and GCC, have been installed in your system, it is recommended to install manually by referring to the installation steps in the [Environment Preparation-manual](#environment-preparation-manual) section.

## Environment Preparation-automatic recommended

The root permission is required because the automatic installation script needs to change the software source configuration and install dependencies via APT. Run the following command to obtain and run the automatic installation script. The environment configured by the automatic installation script only supports compiling MindSpore>=1.6.0.

```bash
wget https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/raw/r1.9/scripts/install/ubuntu-cpu-source.sh
# install Python 3.7 by default
bash ./ubuntu-cpu-source.sh
# to specify Python version, taking Python 3.9 as an example, use the following manner
# PYTHON_VERSION=3.9 bash ./ubuntu-cpu-source.sh
```

This script performs the following operations:

- Change the software source configuration to a HUAWEI CLOUD source.
- Install the compilation dependencies required by MindSpore, such as GCC, CMake, etc.
- Install Python3 and pip3 via APT and set them as default.

After the automatic installation script is executed, you need to reopen the terminal window to make the environment variables take effect, and then you can jump to the [Downloading the Source Code from the Code Repository](#downloading-the-source-code-from-the-code-repository) section to downloading and compiling MindSpore.

For more usage, see the script header description.

The following describes how to install the third-party dependencies.

### Installing Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) can be installed in multiple ways.

- Install Python with Conda.

    Install Miniconda:

    ```bash
    cd /tmp
    curl -O https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-$(arch).sh
    bash Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-$(arch).sh -b
    cd -
    . ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    conda init bash
    ```

    After the installation is complete, you can set up Tsinghua source acceleration download for Conda, and see [here](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/anaconda/).

    Create a virtual environment, taking Python 3.7.5 as an example:

    ```bash
    conda create -n mindspore_py37 python=3.7.5 -y
    conda activate mindspore_py37
    ```

- Or install Python via APT with the following command.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common -y
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa -y
    sudo apt-get install python3.7 python3.7-dev python3.7-distutils python3-pip -y
    # set new installed Python as default
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.7 100
    # install pip
    python -m pip install pip -i https://repo.huaweicloud.com/repository/pypi/simple
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/pip pip ~/.local/bin/pip3.7 100
    pip config set global.index-url https://repo.huaweicloud.com/repository/pypi/simple
    ```

    To install other Python versions, just change `3.7` in the command.

Run the following command to check the Python version.

```bash
python --version
```

### Installing wheel and setuptools

After installing Python, run the following command to install them.

```bash
pip install wheel
pip install -U setuptools
```

### Installing GCC git tclsh patch and NUMA

Run the following commands to install GCC, git, tclsh, patch and NUMA.

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-7 git tcl patch libnuma-dev -y
```

To install a later version of GCC, run the following command to install GCC 8.

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-8 -y
```

Or install GCC 9.

```bash
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-9 -y
```

### Installing CMake

Run the following command to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

```bash
wget -O - https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc 2>/dev/null | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-add-repository "deb https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ $(lsb_release -cs) main"
sudo apt-get install cmake -y
```

### Installing LLVM-optional

Run the following command to install [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).

```bash
wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://apt.llvm.org/bionic/ llvm-toolchain-bionic-12 main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install llvm-12-dev -y
```

## Downloading the Source Code from the Code Repository

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore.git -b r1.9
```

## Compiling MindSpore

Go to the root directory of mindspore, then run the compilation script.

```bash
cd mindspore
bash build.sh -e cpu -j4 -S on
```

Where:

- If the compiler performance is good, add `-j{Number of threads}` to increase the number of threads. For example, `bash build.sh -e cpu -j12`.
- By default, the dependent source code is downloaded from GitHub. When -S is set to `on`, the source code is downloaded from the corresponding Gitee image.
- For details about how to use `build.sh`, see the script header description.

## Installing MindSpore

```bash
pip install output/mindspore-*.whl -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

When the network is connected, dependencies of MindSpore are automatically downloaded during the .whl package installation. For details about dependencies, see required_package in the [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.9/setup.py). In other cases, install the dependencies by yourself. When running a model, you need to install additional dependencies based on the requirements.txt file specified by different models in the [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/r1.9/). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.9/requirements.txt).

## Installation Verification

```bash
python -c "import mindspore;mindspore.run_check()"
```

The output should be like:

```text
MindSpore version: __version__
The result of multiplication calculation is correct, MindSpore has been installed successfully!
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

## Version Update

Using the following command if you need to update the MindSpore version:

- Update online directly

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade mindspore
    ```

- Update after source code compilation

    After successfully executing the compilation script `build.sh` in the root path of the source code, find the whl package in path `output`, and use the following command to update your version.

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade mindspore-*.whl
    ```
