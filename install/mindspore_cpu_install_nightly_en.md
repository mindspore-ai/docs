(For details about the dependency, see required_package in [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.6/setup.py) .) In other cases, you need to install it by yourself. When running models, you need to install additional dependencies based on requirements.txt specified for different models in [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/r1.6/). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.6/requirements.txt).
