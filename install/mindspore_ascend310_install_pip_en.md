### Installing Ascend AI processor software package

For detailed installation guide, please refer to [Ascend Software Installation Guide](https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/zh/ascend-computing/ascend-data-center-solution-pid-251167910?category=installation-upgrade&subcategory=software-deployment-guide).

The default installation path of the installation package is `/usr/local/Ascend`. Ensure that the current user has the right to access the installation path `/usr/local/Ascend` of Ascend AI processor software package, If not, the root user needs to add the current user to the user group where `/usr/local/Ascend` is located.

Install the .whl packages provided in Ascend AI processor software package. The .whl packages are released with the software package. If the .whl packages have been installed before, you need to uninstall the packages by the following command.

```bash
pip uninstall te topi hccl -y
```

Run the following command to install the .whl packages if the Ascend AI package has been installed in default path. If the installation path is not the default path, you need to replace the path in the command with the installation path.

```bash
pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64/topi-*-py3-none-any.whl
pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64/te-*-py3-none-any.whl
pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64/hccl-*-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Installing Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) can be installed by Conda.

Install Miniconda:

```bash
cd /tmp
curl -O https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
cd -
. ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda init bash
```

Create a Python 3.7.5 environment:

```bash
conda create -n mindspore_py37 python=3.7.5 -y
conda activate mindspore_py37
```

Or create a Python 3.9.0 environment:

```bash
conda create -n mindspore_py39 python=3.9.0 -y
conda activate mindspore_py39
```

Run the following command to check the Python version.

```bash
python --version
```

If you are using a ARM architecture system, please ensure that pip installed for current Python has a version >= 19.3. If not, upgrade pip with the following command.

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
```

    # aarch64 run
    curl -O https://cmake.org/files/v3.19/cmake-3.19.8-Linux-aarch64.sh
    ```

    run the script to install CMake, which is installed in the `/usr/local` by default.

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /usr/local/cmake-3.19.8
    sudo bash cmake-3.19.8-Linux-*.sh --prefix=/usr/local/cmake-3.19.8 --exclude-subdir
    ```

    Finally, add CMake to the `PATH` environment variable. Run the following commands if it is installed in the default path, other installation path need to be modified accordingly.

    ```bash
    echo -e "export PATH=/usr/local/cmake-3.19.8/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

## Installing MindSpore

First, refer to [Version List](https://www.mindspore.cn/versions) to select the version of MindSpore you want to install, and perform SHA-256 integrity check. Take version 1.6.0 as an example, execute the following commands.

```bash
export MS_VERSION=1.6.0
```

Then run the following commands to install MindSpore according to the system architecture and Python version.

```bash
# x86_64 + Python3.7
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/${MS_VERSION}/MindSpore/ascend/x86_64/mindspore_ascend-${MS_VERSION/-/}-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# x86_64 + Python3.9
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/${MS_VERSION}/MindSpore/ascend/x86_64/mindspore_ascend-${MS_VERSION/-/}-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# aarch64 + Python3.7
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/${MS_VERSION}/MindSpore/ascend/aarch64/mindspore_ascend-${MS_VERSION/-/}-cp37-cp37m-linux_aarch64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# aarch64 + Python3.9
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/${MS_VERSION}/MindSpore/ascend/aarch64/mindspore_ascend-${MS_VERSION/-/}-cp39-cp39-linux_aarch64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

When the network is connected, dependencies of MindSpore are automatically downloaded during the .whl package installation. For details about dependencies, see required_package in the [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/master/setup.py). In other cases, install the dependencies by yourself. When running a model, you need to install additional dependencies based on the requirements.txt file specified by different models in the [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/master/requirements.txt).

## Configuring Environment Variables

After MindSpore is installed, export runtime environment variables. In the following command, `/usr/local/Ascend` in `LOCAL_ASCEND=/usr/local/Ascend` indicates the installation path of the software package. Change it to the actual installation path.

```bash
# control log level. 0-DEBUG, 1-INFO, 2-WARNING, 3-ERROR, 4-CRITICAL, default level is WARNING.
export GLOG_v=2

# Conda environmental options
LOCAL_ASCEND=/usr/local/Ascend # the root directory of run package

# lib libraries that the run package depends on
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64:${LOCAL_ASCEND}/driver/lib64:${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp/op_impl/built-in/ai_core/tbe/op_tiling:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# lib libraries that the mindspore depends on, modify "pip3" according to the actual situation
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pip3 show mindspore-ascend | grep Location | awk '{print $2"/mindspore/lib"}' | xargs realpath`:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# Environment variables that must be configured
## TBE operator implementation tool path
export TBE_IMPL_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp/op_impl/built-in/ai_core/tbe
## OPP path
export ASCEND_OPP_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp
## TBE operator compilation tool path
export PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/ccec_compiler/bin/:${PATH}
## Python library that TBE implementation depends on
export PYTHONPATH=${TBE_IMPL_PATH}:${PYTHONPATH}
```

## Verifying the Installation

Create a directory to store the sample code project, for example, `/home/HwHiAiUser/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/20.0.RC1/acllib_linux.arm64/sample/acl_execute_model/ascend310_single_op_sample`. You can obtain the code from the [official website](https://obs.dualstack.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/mindspore-website/sample_resources/ascend310_single_op_sample.zip). A simple example of adding `[1, 2, 3, 4]` to `[2, 3, 4, 5]` is used and the code project directory structure is as follows:

```text

└─ascend310_single_op_sample
    ├── CMakeLists.txt                    // Build script
    ├── README.md                         // Usage description
    ├── main.cc                           // Main function
    └── tensor_add.mindir                 // MindIR model file
```

Go to the directory of the sample project and change the path based on the actual requirements.

```bash
cd /home/HwHiAiUser/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/20.0.RC1/acllib_linux.arm64/sample/acl_execute_model/ascend310_single_op_sample
```

Build a project by referring to `README.md`, modify `pip3` according to the actual situation.

```bash
cmake . -DMINDSPORE_PATH=`pip3 show mindspore-ascend | grep Location | awk '{print $2"/mindspore"}' | xargs realpath`
make
```

After the build is successful, execute the case.

```bash
./tensor_add_sample
```

The following information is displayed:

```text
