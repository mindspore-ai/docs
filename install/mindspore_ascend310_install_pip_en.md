The following describes how to install MindSpore by pip on Linux in the Ascend 310 environment, MindSpore in Ascend 310 only supports inference.

- If you want to install MindSpore by pip on EulerOS 2.8 with Ascend AI processor software package installed, you may use an [automatic installation script](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/raw/master/scripts/install/euleros-ascend310-pip.sh) for one-click installation. For details, see [Automatic Installation](#automatic-installation). The script will automatically install MindSpore and its required dependencies.

- If your system is Ubuntu 18.04/CentOS 7.6, or some dependencies, such as Python and GCC, have been installed, it is recommended to install manually by referring to the installation steps in the [Manual Installation](#manual-installation).

## Automatic Installation

Before running the automatic installation script, you need to make sure that the Ascend AI processor software package is correctly installed on your system. If it is not installed, please refer to the section [Installing Ascend AI processor software package](#installing-ascend-ai-processor-software-package) to install it.

Run the following command to obtain and run the automatic installation script. The automatic installation script supports only MindSpore>=1.6.0 or later.

```bash
wget https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/raw/master/scripts/install/euleros-ascend310-pip.sh
# install MindSpore 1.9.0 and Python 3.7
# the default value of LOCAL_ASCEND is /usr/local/Ascend
MINDSPORE_VERSION=2.0.0rc1 bash -i ./euleros-ascend310-pip.sh
# to specify Python and MindSpore version, taking Python 3.9 and MindSpore 1.6.0 as examples
# and set LOCAL_ASCEND to /home/xxx/Ascend, use the following manners
# LOCAL_ASCEND=/home/xxx/Ascend MINDSPORE_VERSION=1.6.0 bash -i ./euleros-ascend310-pip.sh
```

This script performs the following operations:

- Install the dependencies required by MindSpore, such as GCC.
- Install Python3 and pip3 and set them as default.
- Install MindSpore Ascend 310 by pip.

After the script is executed, you need to reopen the terminal window to make the environment variables take effect.

The automatic installation script creates a virtual environment named `mindspore_pyXX` for MindSpore. Where `XX` is the Python version, such as Python 3.7, the virtual environment name is `mindspore_py37`. Run the following command to show all virtual environments.

```bash
conda env list
```

Take Python 3.7 as an example, run the following command to activate the virtual environment.

```bash
conda activate mindspore_py37
```

Now you can jump to the [Configuring Environment Variables](#configuring-environment-variables) section to set the relevant environment variables.

For more usage, see the script header description.

## Manual Installation

The following table lists the system environment and third-party dependencies required for installing MindSpore.

|Software|Version|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Ubuntu 18.04/CentOS 7.6/EulerOS 2.8|-|OS for running and compiling MindSpore|
|[Python](#installing-python)|3.7-3.9|Python environment that MindSpore depends|
|[Ascend AI processor software package](#installing-ascend-ai-processor-software-package)|-|Ascend platform AI computing library used by MindSpore|
|[GCC](#installing-gcc)|7.3.0|C++ compiler for compiling MindSpore|
|[CMake](#installing-cmake)|3.18.3 or later| Compilation tool that builds MindSpore                  |

The following describes how to install the third-party dependencies.

### Installing Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) can be installed by Conda.

Install Miniconda:

```bash
cd /tmp
curl -O https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-$(arch).sh
bash Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-$(arch).sh -b
cd -
. ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda init bash
```

After the installation is complete, you can set up Tsinghua source acceleration download for Conda, and see [here](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/anaconda/).

Create a virtual environment, taking Python 3.7.5 as an example:

```bash
conda create -n mindspore_py37 python=3.7.5 -y
conda activate mindspore_py37
```

Run the following command to check the Python version.

```bash
python --version
```

If you are using ARM architecture, ensure that pip installed for current Python is 19.3 or later. If not, upgrade pip using the following command.

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
```

### Installing Ascend AI processor software package

Ascend software package provides two distributions, commercial edition and community edition:

- Commercial edition needs approval from Ascend to download, for detailed installation guide, please refer to [Ascend Data Center Solution 22.0.0 Installation Guide].

- Community edition has no restrictions, choose `6.0.1.alpha001` in [CANN community edition](https://www.hiascend.com/software/cann/community-history), then choose relevant driver and firmware packages in [firmware and driver](https://www.hiascend.com/hardware/firmware-drivers?tag=community). Please refer to the abovementioned commercial edition installation guide to choose which packages are to be installed and how to install them.

The default installation path of the installation package is `/usr/local/Ascend`. Ensure that the current user has the right to access the installation path of Ascend AI processor software package. If not, the root user needs to add the current user to the user group where `/usr/local/Ascend` is located.

Install the .whl packages provided in Ascend AI processor software package. If the .whl packages have been installed before, you should uninstall the .whl packages by running the following command.

```bash
pip uninstall te topi hccl -y
```

Run the following command to install the .whl packages if the Ascend AI package has been installed in default path. If the installation path is not the default path, you need to replace the path in the command with the installation path.

```bash
pip install sympy
pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/lib64/te-*-py3-none-any.whl
pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/lib64/hccl-*-py3-none-any.whl
```

The LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable does not work when the installation package exists in the default path. The default path priority is: /usr/local/Ascend/nnae is higher than /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit. The reason is that MindSpore uses DT_RPATH to support startup without environment variables, reducing user settings. DT_RPATH has a higher priority than the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

### Installing GCC

- On Ubuntu 18.04, run the following commands to install.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install gcc-7 -y
    ```

- On CentOS 7, run the following commands to install.

    ```bash
    sudo yum install centos-release-scl
    sudo yum install devtoolset-7
    ```

    After installation, run the following commands to switch to GCC 7.

    ```bash
    scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
    ```

- On EulerOS, run the following commands to install.

    ```bash
    sudo yum install gcc -y
    ```

### Installing CMake

- On Ubuntu 18.04, run the following commands to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

    ```bash
    wget -O - https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc 2>/dev/null | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-add-repository "deb https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ $(lsb_release -cs) main"
    sudo apt-get install cmake -y
    ```

- Other Linux systems can be installed with the following commands.

    Choose different download links based on the system architecture.

    ```bash
    # x86 run
    curl -O https://cmake.org/files/v3.19/cmake-3.19.8-Linux-x86_64.sh
    # aarch64 run
    curl -O https://cmake.org/files/v3.19/cmake-3.19.8-Linux-aarch64.sh
    ```

    Run the script to install CMake, which is installed in the `/usr/local` by default.

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /usr/local/cmake-3.19.8
    sudo bash cmake-3.19.8-Linux-*.sh --prefix=/usr/local/cmake-3.19.8 --exclude-subdir
    ```

    Finally, add CMake to the `PATH` environment variable. Run the following commands if it is installed in the default path, and other installation path need to be modified accordingly.

    ```bash
    echo -e "export PATH=/usr/local/cmake-3.19.8/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

### Installing MindSpore

First, refer to [Version List](https://www.mindspore.cn/versions) to select the version of MindSpore you want to install, and perform SHA-256 integrity check. Taking version 2.0.0-rc1 as an example, execute the following commands.

```bash
export MS_VERSION=2.0.0rc1
```

Then run the following commands to install MindSpore according to the system architecture and Python version.

```bash
# x86_64 + Python3.7
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/${MS_VERSION}/MindSpore/unified/x86_64/mindspore-${MS_VERSION/-/}-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# x86_64 + Python3.8
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/${MS_VERSION}/MindSpore/unified/x86_64/mindspore-${MS_VERSION/-/}-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# x86_64 + Python3.9
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/${MS_VERSION}/MindSpore/unified/x86_64/mindspore-${MS_VERSION/-/}-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# aarch64 + Python3.7
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/${MS_VERSION}/MindSpore/unified/aarch64/mindspore-${MS_VERSION/-/}-cp37-cp37m-linux_aarch64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# aarch64 + Python3.8
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/${MS_VERSION}/MindSpore/unified/aarch64/mindspore-${MS_VERSION/-/}-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
# aarch64 + Python3.9
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/${MS_VERSION}/MindSpore/unified/aarch64/mindspore-${MS_VERSION/-/}-cp39-cp39-linux_aarch64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

When the network is connected, dependencies of MindSpore are automatically downloaded during the .whl package installation. For details about dependencies, see required_package in the [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/master/setup.py). In other cases, install the dependencies by yourself. When running a model, you need to install additional dependencies based on the requirements.txt file specified by different models in the [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/master/requirements.txt).

## Configuring Environment Variables

After MindSpore is installed, export runtime environment variables. In the following command, `/usr/local/Ascend` in `LOCAL_ASCEND=/usr/local/Ascend` indicates the installation path of the software package. Change it to the actual installation path.

```bash
# control log level. 0-DEBUG, 1-INFO, 2-WARNING, 3-ERROR, 4-CRITICAL, default level is WARNING.
export GLOG_v=2

# Conda environmental options
LOCAL_ASCEND=/usr/local/Ascend # the root directory of run package

# lib libraries that the run package depends on
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/lib64:${LOCAL_ASCEND}/driver/lib64:${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp/built-in/op_impl/ai_core/tbe/op_tiling:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# lib libraries that the mindspore depends on, modify "pip3" according to the actual situation
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pip3 show mindspore | grep Location | awk '{print $2"/mindspore/lib"}' | xargs realpath`:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# Environment variables that must be configured
## TBE operator implementation tool path
export TBE_IMPL_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp/built-in/op_impl/ai_core/tbe
## OPP path
export ASCEND_OPP_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp
## AICPU path
export ASCEND_AICPU_PATH=${ASCEND_OPP_PATH}/..
## TBE operator compilation tool path
export PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/compiler/ccec_compiler/bin/:${PATH}
## Python library that TBE implementation depends on
export PYTHONPATH=${TBE_IMPL_PATH}:${PYTHONPATH}
```

## Verifying the Installation

Create a directory to store the sample code project, for example, `/home/HwHiAiUser/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/20.0.RC1/acllib_linux.arm64/sample/acl_execute_model/ascend310_single_op_sample`. You can obtain the code from the [official website](https://obs.dualstack.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/mindspore-website/sample_resources/ascend310_single_op_sample.zip). A simple example of adding `[1, 2, 3, 4]` to `[2, 3, 4, 5]` is used and the code project directory structure is as follows:

```text

└─ascend310_single_op_sample
    ├── CMakeLists.txt                    // Build script
    ├── README.md                         // Usage description
    ├── main.cc                           // Main function
    └── tensor_add.mindir                 // MindIR model file
```

Go to the directory of the sample project and change the path based on the actual requirements.

```bash
cd /home/HwHiAiUser/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/20.0.RC1/acllib_linux.arm64/sample/acl_execute_model/ascend310_single_op_sample
```

Build a project by referring to `README.md`, and modify `pip3` according to the actual situation.

```bash
cmake . -DMINDSPORE_PATH=`pip3 show mindspore | grep Location | awk '{print $2"/mindspore"}' | xargs realpath`
make
```

After the build is successful, execute the case.

```bash
./tensor_add_sample
```

The following information is displayed:

```text
