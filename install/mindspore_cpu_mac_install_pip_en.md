[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is an open-source, cross-platform, language-agnostic package manager and environment management system. It allows users to easily install different versions of binary software packages and any required libraries appropriate for their computing platform.

This document describes how to install MindSpore by pip in a macOS system with Conda installed.

## System Environment Information Confirmation

- According to the system and chip situation in the table below, determine the appropriate Python and Conda versions, and for the macOS version and chip information, click on the Apple logo in the upper left corner of the desktop - > `About this mac`:

    |Chip|Architecture|macOS Version|Supported Python Version|Supported Conda Version|
    |-|-|-|-|-|
    |M1|ARM|11.3|Python 3.9-3.11|Mambaforge or Miniforge|
    |Intel|x86_64|10.15/11.3|Python 3.9-3.11|Anaconda or Miniconda|

- Ensure that the Conda version is compatible with the current system and chip.

    - If you prefer the complete capabilities provided by Conda, you may download [Anaconda3](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/) or [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).
    - If you want to save disk space or prefer customizing Conda installation package, you may download [Miniconda3](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/) or [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

## Creating and Accessing the Conda Virtual Environment

Create a Conda virtual environment based on the Python version you want to use and go to the virtual environment.

- If you want to use Python 3.9.11 (for 64-bit macOS 10.15 and 11.3):

  ```bash
  conda create -c conda-forge -n mindspore_py39 -c conda-forge python=3.9.11
  conda activate mindspore_py39
  ```

## Installing MindSpore

First, refer to [Version List](https://www.mindspore.cn/versions) to select the version of MindSpore you want to install, and perform SHA-256 integrity check. Taking version 2.4.10 as an example, execute the following commands.

```bash
export MS_VERSION=2.4.10
```

Then run the following commands to install MindSpore according to the system architecture and Python version.

```bash
# install prerequisites
conda install scipy -c conda-forge

# x86_64 + Python3.9
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/${MS_VERSION}/MindSpore/cpu/x86_64/mindspore-${MS_VERSION/-/}-cp39-cp39-macosx_10_15_x86_64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple

# aarch64 + Python3.9

pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/${MS_VERSION}/MindSpore/cpu/aarch64/mindspore-${MS_VERSION/-/}-cp311-cp311-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

When the network is connected, dependencies of MindSpore are automatically downloaded during the .whl package installation. For details about dependencies, see required_package in the [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/v2.5.0/setup.py). In other cases, install the dependencies by yourself. When running a model, you need to install additional dependencies based on the requirements.txt file specified by different models in the [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/v2.5.0/requirements.txt).

## Installation Verification

```bash
python -c "import mindspore;mindspore.set_device(device_target='CPU');mindspore.run_check()"
```

The outputs should be the same as:

```text
MindSpore version: __version__
The result of multiplication calculation is correct, MindSpore has been installed on platform [CPU] successfully!
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

## Version Update

Use the following command if you need to update the MindSpore version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade mindspore=={version}
```

Of which,

- When updating to a release candidate (RC) version, set `{version}` to the RC version number, for example, 2.0.0.rc1. When updating to a stable release, you can remove `=={version}`.
