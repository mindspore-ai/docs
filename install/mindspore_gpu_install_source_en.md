    - If CUDA is installed in a non-default path, after installing CUDA, environment variable `PATH`(e.g. `export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-${version}/bin:$PATH`) and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`(e.g. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-${version}/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`) need to be set. Please refer to [CUDA installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#post-installation-actions) for detailed post installation actions.

- Ensure that [OpenMPI 4.0.3](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building#easy-build) is installed. (optional, required for single-node/multi-GPU and multi-node/multi-GPU training)

- Ensure that [OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later](https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git) is installed.
    - Ensure that [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) is installed and set system variable `export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR="OpenSSL installation directory"`.

- Ensure that [NCCL 2.7.6](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-install-guide/index.html#debian) for CUDA 10.1 or [NCCL 2.7.8](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-install-guide/index.html#debian) for CUDA 11.1 is installed. (optional, required for single-node/multi-GPU and multi-node/multi-GPU training)

- Ensure that [TensorRT-7.2.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-tensorrt-download) is installed. (optionalï¼Œrequired for Serving inference)

- Ensure that [NUMA 2.0.11 or later](https://github.com/numactl/numactl) is installed.
     If not, use the following command to install it:

    ```bash
    apt-get install libnuma-dev
    ```

- Ensure that the git is installed, otherwise execute the following command to install git:

    ```bash
    apt-get install git # for linux distributions using apt, e.g. ubuntu
    yum install git     # for linux distributions using yum, e.g. centos
    ```

## Downloading Source Code from Code Repository

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore.git -b r1.5
```

## Compiling MindSpore

Run the following command in the root directory of the source code to compile MindSpore:

```bash
bash build.sh -e gpu
```

Of which,

- In the `build.sh` script, the default number of compilation threads is 8. If the compiler performance is poor, compilation errors may occur. You can add -j{Number of threads} in to script to reduce the number of threads. For example, `bash build.sh -e ascend -j4`.

## Installing MindSpore

```bash
pip install output/mindspore_gpu-{version}-{python_version}-linux_x86_64.whl -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

Of which,

- When the network is connected, dependency items are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. (For details about the dependency, see required_package in [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.5/setup.py) .) In other cases, you need to install it by yourself. When running models, you need to install additional dependencies based on requirements.txt specified for different models in [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/r1.5/). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.5/requirements.txt).
- `{version}` specifies the MindSpore version number. For example, when installing MindSpore 1.5.0-rc1, set `{version}` to 1.5.0rc1.
- `{python_version}` spcecifies the python version for which MindSpore is built. If you wish to use Python3.7.5,`{python_version}` should be `cp37-cp37m`. If Python3.9.0 is used, it should be `cp39-cp39`.

## Installation Verification

i:

```bash
python -c "import mindspore;mindspore.run_check()"
```

The outputs should be the same as:

```text
MindSpore version: __version__
The result of multiplication calculation is correct, MindSpore has been installed successfully!
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

ii:

```python
import numpy as np
from mindspore import Tensor
import mindspore.ops as ops
import mindspore.context as context

context.set_context(device_target="GPU")
x = Tensor(np.ones([1,3,3,4]).astype(np.float32))
y = Tensor(np.ones([1,3,3,4]).astype(np.float32))
print(ops.add(x, y))
```

- The outputs should be the same as:

```text
[[[[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]

  [[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]

  [[2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]
   [2. 2. 2. 2.]]]]
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

## Version Update

Using the following command if you need to update the MindSpore version.

- Update online

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade mindspore-gpu
    ```

     Note: MindSpore with CUDA11 is selected by default when upgrading version 1.3.0 and above. If you still want to use MindSpore with CUDA10, please select the corresponding wheel installation package.

- Update after source code compilation

     After successfully executing the compile script `build.sh` in the root path of the source code, find the whl package in path `output`, use the following command to update your version.

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade mindspore_gpu-{version}-{python_version}-linux_{arch}.whl
    ```
