This document describes how to quickly install MindSpore in a Linux system with an Ascend 910 environment by pip.

## System Environment Information Confirmation

- Confirm that Ubuntu 18.04/CentOS 8.2/EulerOS 2.8 is installed with the 64-bit operating system.
- Ensure that right version [GCC](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/) is installed, for Ubuntu 18.04, EulerOS 2.8 users, GCC>=7.3.0; for CentOS 8.2 users, GCC>=8.3.1 .
- Confirm that [gmp 6.1.2](https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.1.2.tar.xz) is installed.
- Confirm that Python 3.7.5 is installed.
    - If you didn't install Python or you have installed other versions, please download the Python 3.7.5 64-bit from [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.5/Python-3.7.5.tgz) or [Huaweicloud](https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/python/3.7.5/Python-3.7.5.tgz) to install.
- Confirm that the Ascend 910 AI processor software package ([Atlas Data Center Solution V100R020C20](https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/zh/ascend-computing/atlas-data-center-solution-pid-251167910/software/251826872)) are installed.
- Confirm that the current user has the right to access the installation path `/usr/local/Ascend`of Ascend 910 AI processor software package, If not, the root user needs to add the current user to the user group where `/usr/local/Ascend` is located. For the specific configuration, please refer to the software package instruction document.
    - Install the .whl package provided in Ascend 910 AI processor software package. The .whl package is released with the software package. After software package is upgraded, reinstall the .whl package.

        ```bash
        pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64/topi-{version}-py3-none-any.whl
        pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64/te-{version}-py3-none-any.whl
        pip install /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64/hccl-{version}-py3-none-any.whl
        ```

    - If the Ascend 910 AI processor software package is upgraded, the .whl package need update too, using the following command to uninstall the .whl packages firstly, and then reinstall them.

        ```bash
        pip uninstall te topi hccl -y
        ```

## Installing MindSpore

```bash
pip install https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/{version}/MindSpore/ascend/{system}/mindspore_ascend-{version}-cp37-cp37m-linux_{arch}.whl --trusted-host ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

Of which,

- When the network is connected, dependency items are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. (For details about other dependency items, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.1/requirements.txt)). In other cases, you need to manually install dependency items.  
- `{version}` denotes the version of MindSpore. For example, when you are installing MindSpore 1.1.0, `{version}` should be 1.1.0.  
- `{arch}` denotes the system architecture. For example, the Linux system you are using is x86 architecture 64-bit, `{arch}` should be `x86_64`. If the system is ARM architecture 64-bit, then it should be `aarch64`.  
- `{system}` denotes the system version. For example, if you are using EulerOS ARM architecture, `{system}` should be `euleros_aarch64`. Currently, the following systems are supported by Ascend: `euleros_aarch64`/`centos_x86`/`ubuntu_aarch64`/`ubuntu_x86`.

## Configuring Environment Variables

- **If Ascend 910 AI processor software is installed in a non-default path**, after MindSpore is installed, export runtime-related environment variables. `/usr/local/Ascend` in the following command `LOCAL_ASCEND=/usr/local/Ascend` denotes the installation path of the software package, please replace it as your actual installation path.

    ```bash
    # control log level. 0-DEBUG, 1-INFO, 2-WARNING, 3-ERROR, default level is WARNING.
    export GLOG_v=2

    # Conda environmental options
    LOCAL_ASCEND=/usr/local/Ascend # the root directory of run package

    # lib libraries that the run package depends on
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/lib64:${LOCAL_ASCEND}/driver/lib64:${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp/op_impl/built-in/ai_core/tbe/op_tiling:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

    # Environment variables that must be configured
    export TBE_IMPL_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp/op_impl/built-in/ai_core/tbe            # TBE operator implementation tool path
    export ASCEND_OPP_PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/opp                                       # OPP path
    export PATH=${LOCAL_ASCEND}/ascend-toolkit/latest/fwkacllib/ccec_compiler/bin/:${PATH}                 # TBE operator compilation tool path
    export PYTHONPATH=${TBE_IMPL_PATH}:${PYTHONPATH}
    # Python library that TBE implementation depends on
    ```

## Installation Verification

- After configuring the environment variables, execute the following Python scriptï¼š

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from mindspore import Tensor
    import mindspore.ops as ops
    import mindspore.context as context

    context.set_context(device_target="Ascend")
    x = Tensor(np.ones([1,3,3,4]).astype(np.float32))
    y = Tensor(np.ones([1,3,3,4]).astype(np.float32))
    print(ops.tensor_add(x, y))
    ```

- The outputs should be the same as:

    ```text
    [[[ 2.  2.  2.  2.],
      [ 2.  2.  2.  2.],
      [ 2.  2.  2.  2.]],

     [[ 2.  2.  2.  2.],
      [ 2.  2.  2.  2.],
      [ 2.  2.  2.  2.]],

     [[ 2.  2.  2.  2.],
      [ 2.  2.  2.  2.],
      [ 2.  2.  2.  2.]]]
    ```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.
