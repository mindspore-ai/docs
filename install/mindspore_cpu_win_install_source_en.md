This document describes how to install MindSpore by compiling source code on Windows system in a CPU environment.

## System Environment Information Confirmation

- Caurrently supports Windows 10/11 with the x86 architecture 64-bit operating system.
- Ensure that [Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes) is installed. Workloads select `Desktop development with C++` and `Universal Windows Platform development`, Individual components select `Select C++ CMake tools for Windows`.
- Ensure that [git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.29.2.windows.2/Git-2.29.2.2-64-bit.exe) tool is installed. Meanwhile, put Git insitall directory into `Path` environment variable. If git is installed in `D:\Program Files\Git`,then add `D:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin` into `Path` variable.
- Ensure that [CMake 3.22.2](https://cmake.org/files/v3.22/cmake-3.22.2-windows-x86_64.msi) is installed. After installing, add the path of `cmake.exe` to the environment variable `Path`.
- Ensure that you have Python(>=3.9.0) installed. If not installed, follow the links to [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) or [Huawei Cloud](https://repo.huaweicloud.com/python/) to download and install Python.
- Ensure that [wheel 0.32.0 and later](https://pypi.org/project/wheel/) is installed.
- Ensure that [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/pyyaml/) (>=6.0 and <= 6.0.2) is installed. Use `pip install pyyaml` if it's not installed.
- Ensure that [MSYS2 software](https://www.msys2.org/) is installed. For details, please check [Installing MSYS2 Software on Windows](https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/r2.4.0/install/third_party/msys_software_install_en.md).
- Ensure that [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) (>=1.19.3 and <= 1.26.4) is installed. Use `pip install numpy` if it's not installed.

## Downloading Source Code from Code Repository

```bash
git clone -b r2.4.0 https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore.git
```

## Compiling MindSpore

Run the following command in the root directory of the source code to compile MindSpore:

```bash
call build.bat ms_vs_cpu
```

## Installing MindSpore

```bash
for %x in (output\mindspore*.whl) do pip install %x -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

When the network is connected, dependency items are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. (For details about the dependency, see required_package in [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/v2.4.0/setup.py).) In other cases, you need to install it by yourself. When running models, you need to install additional dependencies based on requirements.txt specified for different models in [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/v2.4.0/requirements.txt).

## Installation Verification

```bash
cd ..
python -c "import mindspore;mindspore.set_context(device_target='CPU');mindspore.run_check()"
```

Importing MindSpore installed by pip should be done outside MindSpore source code base directory, as Python for Windows processes environment paths differently.
The outputs should be the same as:

```text
MindSpore version: __version__
The result of multiplication calculation is correct, MindSpore has been installed on platform [CPU] successfully!
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

## Version Update

After successfully executing the compile script `build.bat` in the root path of the source code, find the whl package in path `output`, and use the following command to update your version.

```bash
pip install --upgrade mindspore*.whl
```
