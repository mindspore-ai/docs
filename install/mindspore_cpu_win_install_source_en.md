This document describes how to quickly install MindSpore by source code in a Windows system with a CPU environment.

## System Environment Information Confirmation

- Ensure that Windows 10 is installed with the x86 architecture 64-bit operating system.

- Ensure that [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-CN/download/details.aspx?id=48145) is installed.

- Ensure that [git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.29.2.windows.2/Git-2.29.2.2-64-bit.exe) tool is installed.
    - If git was not installed in `ProgramFiles`, you will need to set environment variable to where `patch.exe` is allocated. For example, when git was install in `D:\git`, `set MS_PATCH_PATH=D:\git\usr\bin`.

- Ensure that [MinGW-W64 GCC-7.3.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/7.3.0/threads-posix/seh/x86_64-7.3.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v5-rev0.7z) is installed.
    - Ensure that path of source code does not include special characters (Chinese, Janpanese characters etc.). After installing, add the path `MinGW\bin`to the environment variable PATH.For example, the installation directory is in `D:\gcc`, then you will need to add `D:\gcc\MinGW\bin` to the system environment variable PATH.

- Ensure that [CMake 3.18.3](https://github.com/Kitware/Cmake/releases/tag/v3.18.3) is installed.
    - Ensure that path of source code does not include special characters (Chinese, Janpanese characters etc.). After installing, add the path of `cmake.exe` to the environment variable PATH.

- Ensure that [ActivePerl 5.28.1.2801 or later](https://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/releases/5.28.1.2801/ActivePerl-5.28.1.2801-MSWin32-x64-24563874.exe) is installed.

- Ensure that Python 3.7.5 or 3.9.0 is installed. If not installed, download and install Python from:

    - Python 3.7.5 (64-bit): [Python official website](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.5/python-3.7.5-amd64.exe) or [HUAWEI CLOUD](https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/python/3.7.5/python-3.7.5-amd64.exe).
    - Python 3.9.0 (64-bit): [Python official website](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.0/python-3.9.0-amd64.exe) or [HUAWEI CLOUD](https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/python/3.9.0/python-3.9.0-amd64.exe).

    - Ensure that path of source code does not include special characters (Chinese, Janpanese characters etc.). After installing, add the path of `python.exe` to the environment variable PATH. The `Scripts` folder in the same directory of `python.exe` is the pip file that comes with Python, you also need to add the path of the pip file to the environment variable PATH.

## Downloading Source Code from Code Repository

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore.git -b r1.6
```

## Compiling MindSpore

Run the following command in the root directory of the source code to compile MindSpore:

```bash
call build.bat
```

## Installing MindSpore

```bash
pip install output/mindspore-{version}-{python_version}-win_amd64.whl -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

Of which,

- When the network is connected, dependency items are automatically downloaded during .whl package installation. (For details about the dependency, see required_package in [setup.py](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.6/setup.py) .) In other cases, you need to install it by yourself. When running models, you need to install additional dependencies based on requirements.txt specified for different models in [ModelZoo](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/r1.6/). For details about common dependencies, see [requirements.txt](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.6/requirements.txt).
- `{version}` specifies the MindSpore version number. For example, when installing MindSpore 1.5.0-rc1, set `{version}` to 1.5.0rc1.
- `{python_version}` spcecifies the python version for which MindSpore is built. If you wish to use Python3.7.5,`{python_version}` should be `cp37-cp37m`. If Python3.9.0 is used, it should be `cp39-cp39`.

## Installation Verification

```bash
python -c "import mindspore;mindspore.run_check()"
```

The outputs should be the same as:

```text
MindSpore version: __version__
The result of multiplication calculation is correct, MindSpore has been installed successfully!
```

It means MindSpore has been installed successfully.

## Version Update

Using the following command if you need to update the MindSpore version:

- Update online

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade mindspore
    ```

- Update after source code compilation

    After successfully executing the compile script `build.bat` in the root path of the source code, find the whl package in path `output`, use the following command to update your version.

```bash
pip install --upgrade mindspore-{version}-{python_version}-win_amd64.whl
```
